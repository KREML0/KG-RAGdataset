Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

最佳(OPT)置换算法 最佳置换算法选择淘汰的页面是以后永不使用的页面, 或是在最长时间内不再被访问的页面, 以便保证获得最低的缺页率。该算法无法实现。 先进先出(FIFO)页面置换算法 FIFO 算法选择淘汰的页面是最早进入内存的页面。该算法实现简单, 但与进程实际运行的规律不相适应, 性能较差。 FIFO 算法还会产生当为进程分配的物理块增多, 缺页次数不减反增的异常现象, 称为 Belady异常。 最近最久未使用(LRU)置换算法 LRU 算法选择淘汰的页面是最近最长时间未使用的页面, 它认为过去一段时间内未访问过的页面, 在最近的将来可能也不会被访问。 LRU 算法性能较好, 但实现起来需要寄存器和栈的硬件支持, 开销较大。 时钟(CLOCK) 置换算法 (1) 简单的CLOCK 置换算法 为每个页面设置一个访问位, 当某页首次被装入或被访问时, 其访问位被置为1。算法将内存中的页面链接成一个循环队列, 并有一个替换指针与之相关联。在选择淘汰一页时, 只需检查页面的访问位:若为0, 就选择该页换出:若为1, 则将它置为0, 暂不换出, 给予该页第二次驻留内存的机会, 再依次顺序检查下一个页面。 (2) 改进型 CLOCK 置换算法 在改进型 CLOCK算法中, 除考虑页面使用情况外, 还增加了置换代价——修改位。在选择页面换出时, 优先考虑既未使用过又未修改过的页面。由访问位A和修改位M可以组合成下面四种类型的页面: 1类(A=0, M=0): 最近未被访问, 且未被修改, 是最佳的淘汰页。 2类(A=0, M=1): 最近未被访问, 但已被修改, 是次佳的淘汰页。 3类(A=1, M=0): 最近已被访问, 但未被修改, 可能再被访问。 4类(A=1, M=1): 最近已被访问, 且已被修改, 可能再被访问。 算法执行时, 按1->2->3->4的顺序分轮扫描, 寻找并淘汰相应类别的页面。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict

②与后一空闲分区相邻, 则合并; ③同时与前、后两个分区相邻, 则三者合并; ④没有相邻的空闲分区, 则为回收区新建一个表项。 (2) 基于顺序搜索的分配算法 首次适应(First Fit)算法。空闲分区按地址递增的次序排列。每次分配内存时, 顺序查找到第一个能满足大小的空闲分区, 分配给作业。 邻近适应(Next Fit)算法。也称循环首次适应算法, 分配内存时从上次查找结束的位置开始继续查找。 最佳适应(Best Fit)算法。空闲分区按容量递增的次序排列。每次分配内存时, 顺序查找到第一个能满足大小的空闲分区, 即最小的空闲分区, 分配给作业。 最坏适应(Worst Fit)算法。空闲分区按容量递减的次序排列。每次分配内存时, 查找到最大的空闲分区, 从中分割一部分空间给作业。 综合来看, 首次适应算法的开销小, 性能最好。 (3) 基于索引搜索的分配算法 快速适应算法。空闲分区的分类根据进程常用的空间大小进行划分。为每类(大小相同)空闲分区, 单独设立一个空闲分区链。 伙伴系统。规定所有分区的大小均为2的k次幂(k为正整数)。 哈希算法。根据空闲分区链表的分布规律, 建立哈希函数, 构建一张以空闲分区大小为关键字的哈希表, 每个表项记录一个对应空闲分区链的头指针。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

链接。由链接程序将编译后形成的一组目标模块, 以及它们所需的库函数链接在一起, 形成一个完整的装入模块。 装入。由装入程序将装入模块装入内存运行。 将一个装入模块装入内存时, 有以下三种装入方式。 (1) 绝对装入 绝对装入方式只适用于单道程序环境。在编译时, 若知道程序将放到内存的哪个位置, 则编译程序将产生绝对地址的目标代码。装入程序按照装入模块的地址, 将程序和数据装入内存。程序中的逻辑地址与实际内存地址完全相同, 因此不需对程序和数据的地址进行修改。 (2) 可重定位装入 可重定位装入也称静态重定位。经过编译、链接后的装入模块的始址(起始地址)通常都是从0开始的, 程序中使用的指令和数据的地址都是相对于始址而言的逻辑地址。可根据内存的当前情况, 将装入模块装入内存的适当位置。在装入时对目标程序中的相对地址的修改过程称为重定位, 地址转换通常是在进程装入时一次完成的。 当一个作业装入内存时, 必须给它分配要求的全部内存空间, 若没有足够的内存, 则无法装入。作业一旦进入内存, 整个运行期间就不能在内存中移动, 也不能再申请内存空间。 (3) 动态运行时装入 动态运行时装入也称动态重定位。程序若要在内存中发生移动, 则要采用动态的装入方式。装入程序将装入模块装入内存后, 并不会立即将装入模块中的相对地址转换为绝对地址, 而是将这种地址转换推迟到程序真正要执行时才进行。因此, 装入内存后的所有地址均为相对地址。这种方式需要一个重定位寄存器(存放装入模块的起始位置)的支持。 动态重定位的优点:可以将程序分配到不连续的存储区;在程序运行前只需装入它的部分代码即可投入运行, 然后在程序运行期间, 根据需要动态申请分配内存;便于程序段的共享。 对目标模块进行链接时, 根据链接的时间不同, 分为以下三种链接方式。 (1) 静态链接 在程序运行之前, 先将各目标模块及它们所需的库函数链接成一个完整的装入模块, 以后不再拆开。 (2) 装入时动态链接 将用户源程序编译后所得到的一组目标模块, 在装入内存时, 采用边装入边链接的方式。其优点是便于修改和更新, 便于实现对目标模块的共享。 (3) 运行时动态链接 在程序执行中需要某目标模块时, 才对它进行链接。凡在程序执行中未用到的目标模块, 都不会被调入内存和链接到装入模块上。其优点是能加快程序的装入过程, 还可节省内存空间。\n```",

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

某数据被访问过, 不久后该数据可能再次被访问。 空间局部性。一旦程序访问了某个存储单元, 在不久后, 其附近的存储单元也将被访问。 虚拟内存技术实际上建立了“内存-外存”的两级存储器结构, 利用局部性原理实现高速缓存。 虚拟存储器的定义和特征 基于局部性原理, 在程序装入时, 仅需将程序当前运行要用到的少数页面(或段)装入内存, 而将其余部分暂留在外存, 便可启动程序执行。在程序执行过程中, 当所访问的信息不在内存时, 由操作系统负责将所需信息从外存调入内存, 然后继续执行程序, 这个过程就是请求调页(或请求调段)功能。当内存空间不够时, 由操作系统负责将内存中暂时用不到的信息换出到外存, 从而腾出空间存放将要调入内存的信息, 这个过程就是页面置换(或段置換)功能。这样, 系统好像为用户提供了一个比实际内存容量大得多的存储器, 称为虚拟存储器。 虚拟存储器有以下三个主要特征: 多次性。无须在作业运行时一次性全部装入内存, 而是允许被分成多次调入内存。 对换性。在作业运行时无须一直常驻内存, 而是允许在作业运行过程中, 将那些暂不使用的程序和数据从内存调至外存的对换区(换出), 待以后需要时再将它们从外存调至内存(换进)。 虚拟性。从逻辑上扩充了内存的容量, 使用户看到的内存容量, 远大于实际容量。 虚拟内存技术的实现 虚拟内存的实现需要建立在离散分配的内存管理方式的基础上。 虚拟内存的实现有以下三种方式: 请求分页存储管理。 请求分段存储管理。 请求段页式存储管理。 一般需要的硬件支持有以下几个方面: 一定容量的内存和外存。 页表机制(或段表机制), 作为主要的数据结构。 中断机构, 当用户程序要访问的部分尚未调入内存时, 则产生中断。 地址变换机构, 逻辑地址到物理地址的变换。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

分页存储管理的逻辑地址结构包含两部分:前一部分为页号P, 后一部分为页内偏移量W。 (3) 页表 为了便于找到进程的每个页面在内存中存放的位置, 系统为每个进程建立一张页面映射表, 简称页表。进程的每个页面对应一个页表项, 每个页表项由页号和块号组成, 它记录了页面在内存中对应的物理块号。页表的作用是实现从页号到物理块号的地址映射。 基本地址变换机构 地址变换机构的任务是将逻辑地址转换为内存中的物理地址。地址变换是借助于页表实现的。 在系统中设置一个页表寄存器(PTR), 存放页表在内存的始址F和页表长度 M。设页面大小为L, 逻辑地址A到物理地址E的变换过程如下: ① 根据逻辑地址计算出页号 P=A/L、页内偏移量 W=A%L。 ② 判断页号是否越界, 若页号P≥页表长度M, 则产生越界中断, 否则继续执行。 ③ 在页表中查询页号对应的页表项, 确定页面存放的物理块号b。 ④ 计算物理地址 E=b*L+W, 用物理地址去访存。 具有快表的地址变换机构 在地址变换机构中增设一个具有并行查找能力的高速缓冲存储器——快表(TLB), 也称相联存储器, 用来存放当前访问的若干页表项, 以加速地址变换的过程。与此对应, 主存中的页表常称为慢表。 在具有快表的分页机制中, 地址的变换过程如下: ① CPU给出逻辑地址后, 由硬件进行地址转换, 将页号与快表中的所有页号进行比较。 ② 若找到匹配的页号, 说明要访问的页表项在快表中有副本, 则直接从中取出该页对应的物理块号, 与页内偏移量拼接形成物理地址。 ③ 若未找到匹配的页号, 则需要访问内存中的页表, 读出页表项后, 就能得到该页的物理块号, 再与页内偏移量拼接形成物理地址。找到页表项后, 应同时将其存入快表, 以便后面的再次访问。 两级页表 为解决页表占用过多连续内存空间的问题, 可采用离散分配方式, 为离散分配的页表再建立一张页表, 称为外层页表(或页目录)。 当采用两级分页时, 逻辑地址空间被划分为一级页号(页目录号)、二级页号和页内偏移量。 在页表的每个表项中, 存放的是进程的某页对应的物理块号。在外层页表的每个表项中, 存放的是某个页表分页的始址。 为了方便实现地址变换, 需要在系统中增设一个外层页表寄存器(也称页目录基址寄存器), 用于存放页目录始址。将逻辑地址中的页目录号作为页目录的索引, 从中找到对应页表的始址; 再用二级页号作为页表分页的索引, 从中找到对应的页表项; 将页表项中的物理块号和页内偏移拼接形成物理地址。共进行了三次访存。 对于更大的逻辑地址空间, 必须采用多级页表, 再对外层页表分页。\n```",

地址变换机构的任务是将逻辑地址转换为内存中的物理地址。地址变换是借助于页表实现的。 在系统中设置一个页表寄存器(PTR), 存放页表在内存的始址F和页表长度 M。设页面大小为L, 逻辑地址A到物理地址E的变换过程如下: ① 根据逻辑地址计算出页号 P=A/L、页内偏移量 W=A%L。 ② 判断页号是否越界, 若页号P≥页表长度M, 则产生越界中断, 否则继续执行。 ③ 在页表中查询页号对应的页表项, 确定页面存放的物理块号b。 ④ 计算物理地址 E=b*L+W, 用物理地址去访存。 具有快表的地址变换机构 在地址变换机构中增设一个具有并行查找能力的高速缓冲存储器——快表(TLB), 也称相联存储器, 用来存放当前访问的若干页表项, 以加速地址变换的过程。与此对应, 主存中的页表常称为慢表。 在具有快表的分页机制中, 地址的变换过程如下: ①

两级页表 为解决页表占用过多连续内存空间的问题, 可采用离散分配方式, 为离散分配的页表再建立一张页表, 称为外层页表(或页目录)。 当采用两级分页时, 逻辑地址空间被划分为一级页号(页目录号)、二级页号和页内偏移量。 在页表的每个表项中, 存放的是进程的某页对应的物理块号。在外层页表的每个表项中, 存放的是某个页表分页的始址。 为了方便实现地址变换,

对于那些可能被修改的部分, 在将它们换出时必须放在对换区。 UNIX方式。与进程有关的文件都放在文件区, 因此未运行过的页面都应从文件区调入。曾经运行过但又被换出的页面, 应从对换区调入。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

分段 分段系统将用户进程的逻辑地址空间划分为大小不等的段。每段从0开始编址, 并分配一段连续的地址空间(段内要求连续, 段间不要求连续, 进程的地址空间是二维的)。 分段存储管理的逻辑地址结构由段号S与段内偏移量W两部分组成。 在分段系统中, 段号和段内偏移量必须由用户显式提供。 段表 每个进程都有一张逻辑空间与内存空间映射的段表, 进程的每个段对应一个段表项, 段表项记录了该段在内存中的始址和段的长度。 地址变换机构 在系统中设置了一个段表寄存器, 用于存放段表始址F和段表长度M。从逻辑地址到物理地址E之间的地址变换过程如下: ① 从逻辑地址A中取出前几位为段号S, 后几位为段内偏移量W。 ② 判断段号是否越界, 若段号S≥段表长度M, 则产生越界中断, 否则继续执行。 ③ 在段表中查询段号对应的段表项。取出段表项中该段的段长C, 若W≥C, 则产生越界中断, 否则继续执行。 ④ 取出段表项中该段的始址b, 计算物理地址 E=b+W, 用物理地址E去访存。 分页和分段的对比 页是信息的物理单位, 分页的主要目的是提高内存利用率, 对用户是不可见的。段是信息的逻辑单位, 分段的主要目的是更好地满足用户需求, 对用户是可见的。 页的大小固定且由系统决定。段的长度不固定, 具体取决于用户所编写的程序。 分页管理的地址空间是一维的。分段管理的地址空间是二维的。 段的共享与保护 在分段系统中, 为实现段共享, 在系统中配置一张共享段表, 所有共享的段都在共享段表中占一个表项。 可重入代码或纯代码是一种允许多个进程同时访问的代码。 与分页管理类似, 分段管理的保护方法主要有两种: 一种是存取控制保护, 另一种是地址越界保护。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\",

    "original_prompt": "---Task---\nBased on the last extraction task, identify and extract any **missed or incorrectly formatted** entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Strict Adherence to System Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system instructions.\n2.  **Focus on Corrections/Additions:**\n    *   **Do NOT** re-output entities and relationships that were **correctly and fully** extracted in the last task.\n    *   If an entity or relationship was **missed** in the last task, extract and output it now according to the system format.\n    *   If an entity or relationship was **truncated, had missing fields, or was otherwise incorrectly formatted** in the last task, re-output the *corrected and complete* version in the specified format.\n3.  **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Alex<|#|>person<|#|>Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>Taylor<|#|>person<|#|>Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.\nentity<|#|>Jordan<|#|>person<|#|>Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.\nentity<|#|>Cruz<|#|>person<|#|>Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>The Device<|#|>equiment<|#|>The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Taylor<|#|>power dynamics, observation<|#|>Alex observes Taylor's authoritarian behavior and notes changes in Taylor's attitude toward the device.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Jordan<|#|>shared goals, rebellion<|#|>Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz's vision.)\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>Jordan<|#|>conflict resolution, mutual respect<|#|>Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce.\nrelation<|#|>Jordan<|#|>Cruz<|#|>ideological conflict, rebellion<|#|>Jordan's commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz's vision of control and order.\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>The Device<|#|>reverence, technological significance<|#|>Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nStock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.
