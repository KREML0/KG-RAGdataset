接着, 调用实际的调用指令, 然后执行一个陷入指令, 将CPU状态从用户态转为内核态, 再后由硬件和操作系统内核程序保护被中断进程的现场, 将程序计数器(PC)、程序状态字(PSW)及通用寄存器内容等压入堆栈。 第二步, 分析系统调用类型, 转入相应的系统调用处理子程序。 在系统中配置了一张系统调用入口表, 表中的每个表项都对应一个系统调用, 根据系统调用号可以找到该系统调用处理子程序的入口地址。 第三步, 在系统调用处理子程序执行结束后, 恢复被中断的或设置新进程的CPU现场, 然后返回被中断进程或新进程, 继续往下执行。 可以这么理解, 用户程序执行“陷入指令”, 相当于将CPU的使用权主动交给操作系统内核程序(CPU状态会从用户态进入内核态), 之后操作系统内核程序再对系统调用请求做出相应处理。 处理完成后, 操作系统内核程序又会将CPU的使用权还给用户程序(CPU状态会从内核态回到用户态)。 这么设计的目的是: 用户程序不能直接执行对系统影响非常大的操作, 必须通过系统调用的方式请求操作系统代为执行, 以便保证系统的稳定性和安全性。 这样, 操作系统的运行环境可以理解为: 用户通过操作系统运行上层程序(如系统提供的命令解释程序或用户自编程序), 而这个上层程序的运行依赖于操作系统的底层管理程序提供服务支持, 当需要管理程序服务时, 系统通过硬件中断机制进入内核态, 运行管理程序; 也可能是程序运行出现异常情况, 被动地需要管理程序的服务, 此时则通过异常处理进入内核态。 管理程序运行结束时, 退出中断或异常处理程序, 返回到用户程序的断点处继续执行。 下面列举一些由用户态转向内核态的例子: 1) 用户程序要求操作系统的服务, 即系统调用。 2) 发生一次中断。 3) 用户程序中产生了一个错误状态。 4) 用户程序中企图执行一条特权指令。 从内核态转向用户态由一条指令实现, 这条指令也是特权命令, 一般是中断返回指令。\n```",

如无故障, 屏幕会显示CPU、内存、硬盘等信息。 ③加载带有操作系统的硬盘。通电自检后, BIOS开始读取 Boot Sequence(通过CMOS里保存的启动顺序, 或者通过与用户交互的方式), 将控制权交给启动顺序排在第一位的存储设备, 然后CPU将该存储设备引导扇区的内容加载到内存中。 ④加载主引导记录(MBR)。硬盘以特定的标识符区分引导硬盘和非引导硬盘。 若发现一个存储设备不是可引导盘, 就检查下一个存储设备。 如无其他启动设备, 就会死机。 主引导记录 MBR的作用是告诉CPU去硬盘的哪个主分区去找操作系统。 ⑤扫描硬盘分区表, 并加载硬盘活动分区。MBR包含硬盘分区表, 硬盘分区表以特定的标识符区分活动分区和非活动分区。 主引导记录扫描硬盘分区表, 进而识别含有操作系统的硬盘分区(活动分区)。 找到硬盘活动分区后, 开始加载硬盘活动分区, 将控制权交给活动分区。 ⑥加载分区引导记录(PBR)。读取活动分区的第一个扇区, 这个扇区称为分区引导记录(PBR), 其作用是寻找并激活分区根目录下用于引导操作系统的程序(启动管理器)。 ⑦加载启动管理器。分区引导记录搜索活动分区中的启动管理器, 加载启动管理器。 ⑧加载操作系统。将操作系统的初始化程序加载到内存中执行。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

同时, 工人必须接收雇主的命令, 这就是“接口”; 有了工人, 机器就能发挥更大的作用, 因此工人就成了“扩充机器”。 1. 操作系统作为计算机系统资源的管理者 (1)处理机管理 在多道程序环境下, 处理机的分配和运行都以进程(或线程)为基本单位, 因此对处理机的管理可归结为对进程的管理。 并发是指在计算机内同时运行多个进程, 因此进程何时创建、何时撤销、如何管理、如何避免冲突、合理共享就是进程管理最主要的任务。 进程管理的主要功能包括进程控制、进程同步、进程通信、死锁处理、处理机调度等。 (2)存储器管理 存储器管理是为了给多道程序的运行提供良好的环境, 方便用户使用及提高内存的利用率, 主要包括内存分配与回收、地址映射、内存保护与共享和内存扩充等功能。 (3)文件管理 计算机中的信息都是以文件的形式存在的, 操作系统中负责文件管理的部分称为文件系统。 文件管理包括文件存储空间的管理、目录管理及文件读/写管理和保护等。 (4)设备管理 设备管理的主要任务是完成用户的I/O请求, 方便用户使用各种设备, 提高设备的利用率, 主要包括缓冲管理、设备分配、设备处理和虚拟设备等功能。 这些工作都由“工人”负责, “雇主”无须关注。 2. 操作系统作为用户与计算机硬件系统之间的接口 为让用户方便、快捷、可靠地操纵计算机硬件并运行自己的程序, 操作系统还提供用户接口。 操作系统提供的接口主要分为两类: 一类是命令接口, 用户利用这些操作命令来组织和控制作业的执行; 另一类是程序接口, 编程人员可用来请求操作系统服务。 (1)命令接口 使用命令接口进行作业控制的主要方式有两种, 即联机控制方式和脱机控制方式。 按作业控制方式的不同, 可将命令接口分为联机命令接口和脱机命令接口。 联机命令接口也称交互式命令接口, 适用于分时或实时系统的接口。 联机命令由一组键盘操作命令组成。 用户通过控制台或终端输入操作命令, 向系统提出各种服务要求。 用户每输入一条命令, 控制权就转给操作系统的命令解释程序, 然后由命令解释程序解释并执行输入的命令, 进而完成指定的功能。 之后, 控制权转回控制台或终端, 此时用户又可输入下一条命令。 联机命令接口可以这样理解: “雇主”说一句话, “工人”做一件事, 并做出反馈, 这就强调了交互性。 脱机命令接口也称批处理命令接口, 适用于批处理系统。 脱机命令由一组作业控制命令组成。 脱机用户不能直接干预作业的运行, 而应事先用相应的作业控制命令编写一份作业操作说明书, 连同作业一起提交给系统。 当系统调度到该作业时, 由系统中的命令解释程序逐条解释执行作业说明书上的命令, 进而间接地控制作业的运行。 脱机命令接口可以这样理解: “雇主”将要“工人”做的事情写在清单上, “工人”按照清单逐条完成这些事情, 这就是批处理。 (2)程序接口 程序接口由一组系统调用(也称广义指令)组成。 用户通过在程序中使用这些系统调用来请求操作系统为其提供服务, 如使用各种外部设备、申请分配和回收内存及其他各种要求。 当前最流行的是图形用户界面(GUI), 即图形接口。 GUI最终是通过调用程序接口实现的, 用户通过鼠标和键盘在图形界面上单击或使用快捷键, 就能方便地使用操作系统。 严格来说, 图形接口不是操作系统的一部分, 但\n```",

同时, 工人必须接收雇主的命令, 这就是“接口”; 有了工人, 机器就能发挥更大的作用, 因此工人就成了“扩充机器”。 1. 操作系统作为计算机系统资源的管理者 (1)处理机管理 在多道程序环境下, 处理机的分配和运行都以进程(或线程)为基本单位, 因此对处理机的管理可归结为对进程的管理。 并发是指在计算机内同时运行多个进程, 因此进程何时创建、何时撤销、如何管理、如何避免冲突、合理共享就是进程管理最主要的任务。 进程管理的主要功能包括进程控制、进程同步、进程通信、死锁处理、处理机调度等。 (2)存储器管理 存储器管理是为了给多道程序的运行提供良好的环境, 方便用户使用及提高内存的利用率, 主要包括内存分配与回收、地址映射、内存保护与共享和内存扩充等功能。 (3)文件管理 计算机中的信息都是以文件的形式存在的, 操作系统中负责文件管理的部分称为文件系统。 文件管理包括文件存储空间的管理、目录管理及文件读/写管理和保护等。 (4)设备管理 设备管理的主要任务是完成用户的I/O请求, 方便用户使用各种设备, 提高设备的利用率, 主要包括缓冲管理、设备分配、设备处理和虚拟设备等功能。 这些工作都由“工人”负责, “雇主”无须关注。 2. 操作系统作为用户与计算机硬件系统之间的接口 为让用户方便、快捷、可靠地操纵计算机硬件并运行自己的程序, 操作系统还提供用户接口。 操作系统提供的接口主要分为两类: 一类是命令接口, 用户利用这些操作命令来组织和控制作业的执行; 另一类是程序接口, 编程人员可用来请求操作系统服务。 (1)命令接口 使用命令接口进行作业控制的主要方式有两种, 即联机控制方式和脱机控制方式。 按作业控制方式的不同, 可将命令接口分为联机命令接口和脱机命令接口。 联机命令接口也称交互式命令接口, 适用于分时或实时系统的接口。 联机命令由一组键盘操作命令组成。 用户通过控制台或终端输入操作命令, 向系统提出各种服务要求。 用户每输入一条命令, 控制权就转给操作系统的命令解释程序, 然后由命令解释程序解释并执行输入的命令, 进而完成指定的功能。 之后, 控制权转回控制台或终端, 此时用户又可输入下一条命令。 联机命令接口可以这样理解: “雇主”说一句话, “工人”做一件事, 并做出反馈, 这就强调了交互性。 脱机命令接口也称批处理命令接口, 适用于批处理系统。 脱机命令由一组作业控制命令组成。 脱机用户不能直接干预作业的运行, 而应事先用相应的作业控制命令编写一份作业操作说明书, 连同作业一起提交给系统。 当系统调度到该作业时, 由系统中的命令解释程序逐条解释执行作业说明书上的命令, 进而间接地控制作业的运行。 脱机命令接口可以这样理解: “雇主”将要“工人”做的事情写在清单上, “工人”按照清单逐条完成这些事情, 这就是批处理。 (2)程序接口 程序接口由一组系统调用(也称广义指令)组成。 用户通过在程序中使用这些系统调用来请求操作系统为其提供服务, 如使用各种外部设备、申请分配和回收内存及其他各种要求。 当前最流行的是图形用户界面(GUI), 即图形接口。 GUI最终是通过调用程序接口实现的, 用户通过鼠标和键盘在图形界面上单击或使用快捷键, 就能方便地使用操作系统。 严格来说, 图形接口不是操作系统的一部分, 但\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

另一种是用户自编程序(系统外层的应用程序, 简称应用程序)。 对操作系统而言, 这两种程序的作用不同, 前者是后者的管理者, 因此“管理程序”(内核程序)要执行一些特权指令, 而“被管理程序”(用户自编程序)出于安全考虑不能执行这些特权指令。 1) 特权指令, 是指不允许用户直接使用的指令, 如I/O指令、关中断指令、内存清零指令, 存取用于内存保护的寄存器、修改程序状态字寄存器等的指令。 2) 非特权指令, 是指允许用户直接使用的指令, 它不能直接访问系统中的软硬件资源, 仅限于访问用户的地址空间, 这也是为了防止用户程序对系统造成破坏。 在具体实现上, 将CPU的运行模式划分为用户态(目态)和内核态(也称管态、核心态)。 可以理解为CPU内部有一个小开关, 当小开关为0时, CPU处于内核态, 此时CPU可以执行特权指令, 切换到用户态的指令也是特权指令。 当小开关为1时, CPU处于用户态, 此时CPU只能执行非特权指令。 应用程序运行在用户态, 操作系统内核程序运行在内核态。 应用程序向操作系统请求服务时通过使用访管指令, 访管指令是在用户态执行的, 因此是非特权指令。 在软件工程思想和结构化程序设计方法影响下诞生的现代操作系统, 几乎都是分层式的结构。 操作系统的各项功能分别被设置在不同的层次上。 一些与硬件关联较紧密的模块, 如时钟管理、中断处理、设备驱动等处于最低层。 其次是运行频率较高的程序, 如进程管理、存储器管理和设备管理等。 这两部分内容构成了操作系统的内核。 这部分内容的指令运行在内核态。 内核是计算机上配置的底层软件, 它管理着系统的各种资源, 可视为连接应用程序和硬件的一座桥梁, 大多数操作系统的内核包括4方面的内容。 1. 时钟管理 在计算机的各种部件中, 时钟是关键设备。 时钟的第一功能是计时, 操作系统需要通过时钟管理, 向用户提供标准的系统时间。 另外, 通过时钟中断的管理, 可以实现进程的切换。 例如, 在分时操作系统中采用时间片轮转调度, 在实时系统中按截止时间控制运行, 在批处理系统中通过时钟管理来衡量一个作业的运行程度等。 因此, 系统管理的方方面面无不依赖于时钟。 2. 中断机制 引入中断技术的初衷是提高多道程序运行时的CPU利用率, 使CPU可以在I/O操作期间执行其他指令。 后来逐步得到发展, 形成了多种类型, 成为操作系统各项操作的基础。 例如, 键盘或鼠标信息的输入、进程的管理和调度、系统功能的调用、设备驱动、文件访问等, 无不依赖于中断机制。 可以说, 现代操作系统是靠中断驱动的软件。 中断机制中, 只有一小部分功能属于内核, 它们负责保护和恢复中断现场的信息, 转移控制权到相关的处理程序。 这样可以减少中断的处理时间, 提高系统的并行处理能力。 3. 原语 按层次结构设计的操作系统, 底层必然是一些可被调用的公用小程序, 它们各自完成一个规定的操作, 通常将具有这些特点的程序称为原语(Atomic Operation)。 它们的特点如下: 1) 处于操作系统的底层, 是最接近硬件的部分。 2) 这些程序的运行具有原子性, 其操作只能一气呵成(出于系统安全性和便于管理考虑)。 3) 这些程序的运行时间都较短, 而且调用频繁。 定义原语的直接方法是关中断, 让其所有动作不可分割地完成后再打开中断。 系统中的设备驱动、CPU切换、进程通信等功能中的部分操作都可定义为原语, 使它们成为内核的组成部分。 4. 系统控制的数据结构及处理 系统中用来登记状态信息的数据结构很多, 如作业控制块、进程控制块(PCB)、设备控制块、各类链表、消息队列、缓冲区、空闲区登记表、内存分配表等。 为了实现有效的管理, 系统需要一些基本的操作, 常见的操作有以下3种: 1) 进程管理。进程状态管理、进程调\n```",

另一种是用户自编程序(系统外层的应用程序, 简称应用程序)。 对操作系统而言, 这两种程序的作用不同, 前者是后者的管理者, 因此“管理程序”(内核程序)要执行一些特权指令, 而“被管理程序”(用户自编程序)出于安全考虑不能执行这些特权指令。 1) 特权指令, 是指不允许用户直接使用的指令, 如I/O指令、关中断指令、内存清零指令, 存取用于内存保护的寄存器、修改程序状态字寄存器等的指令。 2) 非特权指令, 是指允许用户直接使用的指令, 它不能直接访问系统中的软硬件资源, 仅限于访问用户的地址空间, 这也是为了防止用户程序对系统造成破坏。 在具体实现上, 将CPU的运行模式划分为用户态(目态)和内核态(也称管态、核心态)。 可以理解为CPU内部有一个小开关, 当小开关为0时, CPU处于内核态, 此时CPU可以执行特权指令, 切换到用户态的指令也是特权指令。 当小开关为1时, CPU处于用户态, 此时CPU只能执行非特权指令。 应用程序运行在用户态, 操作系统内核程序运行在内核态。 应用程序向操作系统请求服务时通过使用访管指令, 访管指令是在用户态执行的, 因此是非特权指令。 在软件工程思想和结构化程序设计方法影响下诞生的现代操作系统, 几乎都是分层式的结构。 操作系统的各项功能分别被设置在不同的层次上。 一些与硬件关联较紧密的模块, 如时钟管理、中断处理、设备驱动等处于最低层。 其次是运行频率较高的程序, 如进程管理、存储器管理和设备管理等。 这两部分内容构成了操作系统的内核。 这部分内容的指令运行在内核态。 内核是计算机上配置的底层软件, 它管理着系统的各种资源, 可视为连接应用程序和硬件的一座桥梁, 大多数操作系统的内核包括4方面的内容。 1. 时钟管理 在计算机的各种部件中, 时钟是关键设备。 时钟的第一功能是计时, 操作系统需要通过时钟管理, 向用户提供标准的系统时间。 另外, 通过时钟中断的管理, 可以实现进程的切换。 例如, 在分时操作系统中采用时间片轮转调度, 在实时系统中按截止时间控制运行, 在批处理系统中通过时钟管理来衡量一个作业的运行程度等。 因此, 系统管理的方方面面无不依赖于时钟。 2. 中断机制 引入中断技术的初衷是提高多道程序运行时的CPU利用率, 使CPU可以在I/O操作期间执行其他指令。 后来逐步得到发展, 形成了多种类型, 成为操作系统各项操作的基础。 例如, 键盘或鼠标信息的输入、进程的管理和调度、系统功能的调用、设备驱动、文件访问等, 无不依赖于中断机制。 可以说, 现代操作系统是靠中断驱动的软件。 中断机制中, 只有一小部分功能属于内核, 它们负责保护和恢复中断现场的信息, 转移控制权到相关的处理程序。 这样可以减少中断的处理时间, 提高系统的并行处理能力。 3. 原语 按层次结构设计的操作系统, 底层必然是一些可被调用的公用小程序, 它们各自完成一个规定的操作, 通常将具有这些特点的程序称为原语(Atomic Operation)。 它们的特点如下: 1) 处于操作系统的底层, 是最接近硬件的部分。 2) 这些程序的运行具有原子性, 其操作只能一气呵成(出于系统安全性和便于管理考虑)。 3) 这些程序的运行时间都较短, 而且调用频繁。 定义原语的直接方法是关中断, 让其所有动作不可分割地完成后再打开中断。 系统中的设备驱动、CPU切换、进程通信等功能中的部分操作都可定义为原语, 使它们成为内核的组成部分。 4. 系统控制的数据结构及处理 系统中用来登记状态信息的数据结构很多, 如作业控制块、进程控制块(PCB)、设备控制块、各类链表、消息队列、缓冲区、空闲区登记表、内存分配表等。 为了实现有效的管理, 系统需要一些基本的操作, 常见的操作有以下3种: 1) 进程管理。进程状态管理、进程调\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

而后者是虚的, 是用户感觉上的事物。 用于实现虚拟的技术称为虚拟技术。 操作系统的虚拟技术可归纳为: 时分复用技术, 如虚拟处理器; 空分复用技术, 如虚拟存储器。 通过多道程序设计技术, 让多道程序并发执行, 来分时使用一个处理器。 此时, 虽然只有一个处理器, 但它能同时为多个用户服务, 使每个终端用户都感觉有一个CPU在专门为它服务。 利用多道程序设计技术将一个物理上的CPU虚拟为多个逻辑上的CPU, 称为虚拟处理器。 采用虚拟存储器技术将一台机器的物理存储器变为虚拟存储器, 以便从逻辑上扩充存储器的容量。 当然, 这时用户所感觉到的内存容量是虚的。 我们将用户感觉到(但实际不存在)的存储器称为虚拟存储器。 还可采用虚拟设备技术将一台物理I/O设备虚拟为多台逻辑上的I/O设备, 并允许每个用户占用一台逻辑上的I/O设备, 使原来仅允许在一段时间内由一个用户访问的设备(临界资源)变为在一段时间内允许多个用户同时访问的共享设备。 4. 异步(Asynchronism) 多道程序环境允许多个程序并发执行, 但由于资源有限, 进程的执行并不是一贯到底的, 而是走走停停的, 它以不可预知的速度向前推进, 这就是进程的异步性。 异步性使得操作系统运行在一种随机的环境下, 可能导致进程产生与时间有关的错误(就像对全局变量的访问顺序不当会导致程序出错一样)。 然而, 只要运行环境相同, 操作系统就须保证多次运行进程后都能获得相同的结果。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

又如, 若你在9:00-10:00右手写字, 左手同时拿着面包吃, 则这两个动作就是并行执行的。 在操作系统中, 引入进程的目的是使程序能并发执行。 2. 共享(Sharing) 资源共享即共享, 是指系统中的资源可供内存中多个并发执行的进程共同使用。 资源共享主要可分为互斥共享和同时访问两种方式。 (1)互斥共享方式 系统中的某些资源, 如打印机、磁带机, 虽然可供多个进程使用, 但为使得所打印或记录的结果不致造成混淆, 应规定在一段时间内只允许一个进程访问该资源。 为此, 当进程A访问某个资源时, 必须先提出请求, 若此时该资源空闲, 则系统便将之分配给A使用, 此后有其他进程也要访问该资源时(只要未用完)就必须等待。 仅当A访问完并释放该资源后, 才允许另一个进程对该资源进行访问。 我们将这种资源共享方式称为互斥共享, 而将在一段时间内只允许一个进程访问的资源称为临界资源。 计算机系统中的大多数物理设备及某些软件中所用的栈、变量和表格, 都属于临界资源, 它们都要求被互斥地共享。 (2)同时访问方式 系统中还有另一类资源, 这类资源允许一段时间内由多个进程“同时”访问。 这里所说的“同时”通常是宏观上的, 而在微观上, 这些进程可能是交替地对该资源进行访问, 即“分时共享”的。 可供多个进程“同时”访问的典型资源是磁盘设备, 一些用重入代码编写的文件也可被“同时”共享, 即允许若干用户同时访问该文件。 注意, 互斥共享要求一种资源在一段时间内(哪怕是一段很短的时间)只能满足一个请求, 否则就会出现严重的问题(你能想象打印机第一行打印文档A的内容、第二行打印文档B的内容的效果吗?), 而同时访问共享通常要求一个请求分几个时间片段间隔地完成, 其效果与连续完成的效果相同。 并发和共享是操作系统两个最基本的特征, 两者之间互为存在的条件: ①资源共享是以程序的并发为条件的, 若系统不允许程序并发执行, 则自然不存在资源共享问题; ②若系统不能对资源共享实施有效的管理, 则必将影响到程序的并发执行, 甚至根本无法并发执行。 3. 虚拟(Virtual) 虚拟是指将一个物理上的实体变为若干逻辑上的对应物。 物理实体(前者)是实的, 即实际存在的; 而后者是虚的, 是用户感觉上的事物。 用于实现虚拟的技术称为虚拟技术。 操作系统的\n```",

又如, 若你在9:00-10:00右手写字, 左手同时拿着面包吃, 则这两个动作就是并行执行的。 在操作系统中, 引入进程的目的是使程序能并发执行。 2. 共享(Sharing) 资源共享即共享, 是指系统中的资源可供内存中多个并发执行的进程共同使用。 资源共享主要可分为互斥共享和同时访问两种方式。 (1)互斥共享方式 系统中的某些资源, 如打印机、磁带机, 虽然可供多个进程使用, 但为使得所打印或记录的结果不致造成混淆, 应规定在一段时间内只允许一个进程访问该资源。 为此, 当进程A访问某个资源时, 必须先提出请求, 若此时该资源空闲, 则系统便将之分配给A使用, 此后有其他进程也要访问该资源时(只要未用完)就必须等待。 仅当A访问完并释放该资源后, 才允许另一个进程对该资源进行访问。 我们将这种资源共享方式称为互斥共享, 而将在一段时间内只允许一个进程访问的资源称为临界资源。 计算机系统中的大多数物理设备及某些软件中所用的栈、变量和表格, 都属于临界资源, 它们都要求被互斥地共享。 (2)同时访问方式 系统中还有另一类资源, 这类资源允许一段时间内由多个进程“同时”访问。 这里所说的“同时”通常是宏观上的, 而在微观上, 这些进程可能是交替地对该资源进行访问, 即“分时共享”的。 可供多个进程“同时”访问的典型资源是磁盘设备, 一些用重入代码编写的文件也可被“同时”共享, 即允许若干用户同时访问该文件。 注意, 互斥共享要求一种资源在一段时间内(哪怕是一段很短的时间)只能满足一个请求, 否则就会出现严重的问题(你能想象打印机第一行打印文档A的内容、第二行打印文档B的内容的效果吗?), 而同时访问共享通常要求一个请求分几个时间片段间隔地完成, 其效果与连续完成的效果相同。 并发和共享是操作系统两个最基本的特征, 两者之间互为存在的条件: ①资源共享是以程序的并发为条件的, 若系统不允许程序并发执行, 则自然不存在资源共享问题; ②若系统不能对资源共享实施有效的管理, 则必将影响到程序的并发执行, 甚至根本无法并发执行。 3. 虚拟(Virtual) 虚拟是指将一个物理上的实体变为若干逻辑上的对应物。 物理实体(前者)是实的, 即实际存在的; 而后者是虚的, 是用户感觉上的事物。 用于实现虚拟的技术称为虚拟技术。 操作系统的\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

系统不允许用户程序实现内核态的功能, 而它们又必须使用这些功能。 因此, 需要在内核态建立一些“门”, 以便实现从用户态进入内核态。 在实际操作系统中, CPU运行用户程序时唯一能进入这些“门”的途径就是通过中断或异常。 发生中断或异常时, 运行用户态的CPU会立即进入内核态, 这是通过硬件实现的(例如, 用一个特殊寄存器的一位来表示CPU所处的工作状态, 0表示内核态, 1表示用户态。若要进入内核态, 则只需将该位置0即可)。 中断是操作系统中非常重要的一个概念, 对一个运行在计算机上的实用操作系统而言, 缺少了中断机制, 将是不可想象的。 原因是, 操作系统的发展过程大体上就是一个想方设法不断提高资源利用率的过程, 而提高资源利用率就需要在程序并未使用某种资源时, 将它对那种资源的占有权释放, 而这一行为就需要通过中断实现。 1. 中断和异常的定义 中断(Interruption)也称外中断, 是指来自CPU 执行指令外部的事件, 通常用于信息输入/输出(见第5章), 如设备发出的I/O结束中断, 表示设备输入/输出处理已经完成。 时钟中断, 表示一个固定的时间片已到, 让处理机处理计时、启动定时运行的任务等。 异常(Exception)也称内中断, 是指来自CPU执行指令内部的事件, 如程序的非法操作码、地址越界、运算溢出、虚存系统的缺页及专门的陷入指令等引起的事件。 异常不能被屏蔽, 一旦出现, 就应立即处理。 2. 中断和异常的分类 外中断可分为可屏蔽中断和不可屏蔽中断。 可屏蔽中断是指通过INTR线发出的中断请求, 通过改变屏蔽字可以实现多重中断, 从而使得中断处理更加灵活。 不可屏蔽中断是指通过 NMI线发出的中断请求, 通常是紧急的硬件故障, 如电源掉电等。 此外, 异常也是不能被屏蔽的。 异常可分为故障、自陷和终止。 故障(Fault)通常是由指令执行引起的异常, 如非法操作码、缺页故障、除数为0、运算溢出等。 自陷(Trap, 也称陷入)是一种事先安排的“异常”事件, 用于在用户态下调用操作系统内核程序, 如条件陷阱指令、系统调用指令等。 终止(Abort)是指出现了使得CPU无法继续执行的硬件故障, 如控制器出错、存储器校验错等。 故障异常和自陷异常属于软件中断(程序性异常), 终止异常和外部中断属于硬件中断。 3. 中断和异常的处理过程 中断和异常处理过程的大致描述如下: 当CPU在执行用户程序的第 i 条指令时检测到一个异常事件, 或在执行第 i 条指令后发现一个中断请求信号, 则CPU打断当前的用户程序, 然后转到相应的中断或异常处理程序去执行。 若中断或异常处理程序能够解决相应的问题, 则在中断或异常处理程序的最后, CPU通过执行中断或异常返回指令, 回到被打断的用户程序的第 i 条指令或第 i+1条指令继续执行; 若中断或异常处理程序发现是不可恢复的致命错误, 则终止用户程序。 通常情况下, 对中断和异常的具体处理过程由操作系统(和驱动程序)完成。 注意区分中断处理和子程序调用: ①中断处理程序与被中断的当前程序是相互独立的, 它们之间没有确定的关系; 子程序与主程序是同一程序的两部分, 它们属于主从关系。 ②通常中断的产生都是随机的; 而子程序调用是通过调用指令(CALL)引起的, 是由程序设计者事先安排的。 ③调用子程序的过程完全属于软件处理过程; 而中断处理的过程还需要有专门的硬件电路才能实现。 ④中断处理程序的入口地址可由硬件向量法产生向量地址, 再由向量地址找到入口地址: 子程序的入口地址是由CALL 指令中的地址码给出的。 ⑤调用中断处理程序和子程序都需要保护程序计数器(PC)的内容, 前者由中断隐指令完成, 后者由CALL\n```",

    "return": "Operating System is a system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, serving as the foundational layer between computer hardware and user applications. It is responsible for managing system resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices, ensuring efficient allocation and utilization. The operating system provides common services for computer programs through system calls, enabling applications to interact with the underlying hardware in a controlled and secure manner. It requires privileged instructions to perform critical functions, reflecting its central role in system security and stability. Key characteristics of an operating system include concurrency, allowing multiple processes to execute simultaneously; sharing, enabling multiple users or programs to access resources; virtualization, creating the illusion of dedicated resources; and asynchrony, managing operations that occur at unpredictable times. These features are essential for supporting multitasking, efficient program execution, and reliable system performance. Operating systems also provide user interfaces—both command-line and graphical—for users to interact with hardware and manage system operations. Examples of operating systems include Windows, Linux, and various other platforms used across personal computers, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. The operating system’s role as a core system component is critical to the functioning of modern computing environments.",

系统不允许用户程序实现内核态的功能, 而它们又必须使用这些功能。 因此, 需要在内核态建立一些“门”, 以便实现从用户态进入内核态。 在实际操作系统中, CPU运行用户程序时唯一能进入这些“门”的途径就是通过中断或异常。 发生中断或异常时, 运行用户态的CPU会立即进入内核态, 这是通过硬件实现的(例如, 用一个特殊寄存器的一位来表示CPU所处的工作状态, 0表示内核态, 1表示用户态。若要进入内核态, 则只需将该位置0即可)。 中断是操作系统中非常重要的一个概念, 对一个运行在计算机上的实用操作系统而言, 缺少了中断机制, 将是不可想象的。 原因是, 操作系统的发展过程大体上就是一个想方设法不断提高资源利用率的过程, 而提高资源利用率就需要在程序并未使用某种资源时, 将它对那种资源的占有权释放, 而这一行为就需要通过中断实现。 1. 中断和异常的定义 中断(Interruption)也称外中断, 是指来自CPU 执行指令外部的事件, 通常用于信息输入/输出(见第5章), 如设备发出的I/O结束中断, 表示设备输入/输出处理已经完成。 时钟中断, 表示一个固定的时间片已到, 让处理机处理计时、启动定时运行的任务等。 异常(Exception)也称内中断, 是指来自CPU执行指令内部的事件, 如程序的非法操作码、地址越界、运算溢出、虚存系统的缺页及专门的陷入指令等引起的事件。 异常不能被屏蔽, 一旦出现, 就应立即处理。 2. 中断和异常的分类 外中断可分为可屏蔽中断和不可屏蔽中断。 可屏蔽中断是指通过INTR线发出的中断请求, 通过改变屏蔽字可以实现多重中断, 从而使得中断处理更加灵活。 不可屏蔽中断是指通过 NMI线发出的中断请求, 通常是紧急的硬件故障, 如电源掉电等。 此外, 异常也是不能被屏蔽的。 异常可分为故障、自陷和终止。 故障(Fault)通常是由指令执行引起的异常, 如非法操作码、缺页故障、除数为0、运算溢出等。 自陷(Trap, 也称陷入)是一种事先安排的“异常”事件, 用于在用户态下调用操作系统内核程序, 如条件陷阱指令、系统调用指令等。 终止(Abort)是指出现了使得CPU无法继续执行的硬件故障, 如控制器出错、存储器校验错等。 故障异常和自陷异常属于软件中断(程序性异常), 终止异常和外部中断属于硬件中断。 3. 中断和异常的处理过程 中断和异常处理过程的大致描述如下: 当CPU在执行用户程序的第 i 条指令时检测到一个异常事件, 或在执行第 i 条指令后发现一个中断请求信号, 则CPU打断当前的用户程序, 然后转到相应的中断或异常处理程序去执行。 若中断或异常处理程序能够解决相应的问题, 则在中断或异常处理程序的最后, CPU通过执行中断或异常返回指令, 回到被打断的用户程序的第 i 条指令或第 i+1条指令继续执行; 若中断或异常处理程序发现是不可恢复的致命错误, 则终止用户程序。 通常情况下, 对中断和异常的具体处理过程由操作系统(和驱动程序)完成。 注意区分中断处理和子程序调用: ①中断处理程序与被中断的当前程序是相互独立的, 它们之间没有确定的关系; 子程序与主程序是同一程序的两部分, 它们属于主从关系。 ②通常中断的产生都是随机的; 而子程序调用是通过调用指令(CALL)引起的, 是由程序设计者事先安排的。 ③调用子程序的过程完全属于软件处理过程; 而中断处理的过程还需要有专门的硬件电路才能实现。 ④中断处理程序的入口地址可由硬件向量法产生向量地址, 再由向量地址找到入口地址: 子程序的入口地址是由CALL 指令中的地址码给出的。 ⑤调用中断处理程序和子程序都需要保护程序计数器(PC)的内容, 前者由中断隐指令完成, 后者由CALL\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to

有两类虚拟化方法。 1. 第一类虚拟机管理程序 从技术上讲, 第一类虚拟机管理程序就像一个操作系统, 因为它是唯一一个运行在最高特权级的程序。 它在裸机上运行并且具备多道程序功能。 虚拟机管理程序向上层提供若干虚拟机, 这些虚拟机是裸机硬件的精确复制品。 因为每台虚拟机都与裸机相同, 所以在不同的虚拟机上可以运行任何不同的操作系统。 虚拟机作为用户态的一个进程运行, 不允许执行敏感指令。 然而, 虚拟机上的操作系统认为自己运行在内核态(实际上不是), 称为虚拟内核态。 虚拟机中的用户进程认为自己运行在用户态(实际上确实是)。 当虚拟机操作系统执行了一条CPU处于内核态才允许执行的指令时, 会陷入虚拟机管理程序。 在支持虚拟化的CPU上, 虚拟机管理程序检查这条指令是由虚拟机中的操作系统执行的还是由用户程序执行的。 若是前者, 则虚拟机管理程序将安排这条指令功能的正确执行。 否则, 虚拟机管理程序将模拟真实硬件面对用户态执行敏感指令时的行为。 在过去不支持虚拟化的CPU上, 真实硬件不会直接执行虚拟机中的敏感指令, 这些敏感指令被转为对虚拟机管理程序的调用, 由虚拟机管理程序模拟这些指令的功能。 2. 第二类虚拟机管理程序 第二类虚拟机管理程序是一个依赖于Windows、Linux等操作系统分配和调度资源的程序, 很像一个普通的进程。 第二类虚拟机管理程序仍然伪装成具有CPU和各种设备的完整计算机。 VMware Workstation 是首个x86平台上的第二类虚拟机管理程序。 运行在两类虚拟机管理程序上的操作系统都称为客户操作系统。 对于第二类虚拟机管理程序, 运行在底层硬件上的操作系统称为宿主操作系统。 首次启动时, 第二类虚拟机管理程序像一台刚启动的计算机那样运转, 期望找到的驱动器可以是虚拟设备。 然后将操作系统安装到虚拟磁盘上(其实只是宿主操作系统中的一个文件)。 客户操作系统安装完成后, 就能启动并运行。 虚拟化在 Web主机领域很流行。 没有虚拟化, 服务商只能提供共享托管(不能控制服务器的软件)和独占托管(成本较高)。 当服务商提供租用虚拟机时, 一台物理服务器就可以运行多个虚拟机, 每个虚拟机看起来都是一台完整的服务器, 客户可以在虚拟机上安装自己想用的操作系统和软件, 但是只需支付较低的费用, 这就是市面上常见的“云”主机。 有的教材将第一类虚拟化技术称为裸金属架构, 将第二类虚拟化技术称为寄居架构。\n```",

有两类虚拟化方法。 1. 第一类虚拟机管理程序 从技术上讲, 第一类虚拟机管理程序就像一个操作系统, 因为它是唯一一个运行在最高特权级的程序。 它在裸机上运行并且具备多道程序功能。 虚拟机管理程序向上层提供若干虚拟机, 这些虚拟机是裸机硬件的精确复制品。 因为每台虚拟机都与裸机相同, 所以在不同的虚拟机上可以运行任何不同的操作系统。 虚拟机作为用户态的一个进程运行, 不允许执行敏感指令。 然而, 虚拟机上的操作系统认为自己运行在内核态(实际上不是), 称为虚拟内核态。 虚拟机中的用户进程认为自己运行在用户态(实际上确实是)。 当虚拟机操作系统执行了一条CPU处于内核态才允许执行的指令时, 会陷入虚拟机管理程序。 在支持虚拟化的CPU上, 虚拟机管理程序检查这条指令是由虚拟机中的操作系统执行的还是由用户程序执行的。 若是前者, 则虚拟机管理程序将安排这条指令功能的正确执行。 否则, 虚拟机管理程序将模拟真实硬件面对用户态执行敏感指令时的行为。 在过去不支持虚拟化的CPU上, 真实硬件不会直接执行虚拟机中的敏感指令, 这些敏感指令被转为对虚拟机管理程序的调用, 由虚拟机管理程序模拟这些指令的功能。 2. 第二类虚拟机管理程序 第二类虚拟机管理程序是一个依赖于Windows、Linux等操作系统分配和调度资源的程序, 很像一个普通的进程。 第二类虚拟机管理程序仍然伪装成具有CPU和各种设备的完整计算机。 VMware Workstation 是首个x86平台上的第二类虚拟机管理程序。 运行在两类虚拟机管理程序上的操作系统都称为客户操作系统。 对于第二类虚拟机管理程序, 运行在底层硬件上的操作系统称为宿主操作系统。 首次启动时, 第二类虚拟机管理程序像一台刚启动的计算机那样运转, 期望找到的驱动器可以是虚拟设备。 然后将操作系统安装到虚拟磁盘上(其实只是宿主操作系统中的一个文件)。 客户操作系统安装完成后, 就能启动并运行。 虚拟化在 Web主机领域很流行。 没有虚拟化, 服务商只能提供共享托管(不能控制服务器的软件)和独占托管(成本较高)。 当服务商提供租用虚拟机时, 一台物理服务器就可以运行多个虚拟机, 每个虚拟机看起来都是一台完整的服务器, 客户可以在虚拟机上安装自己想用的操作系统和软件, 但是只需支付较低的费用, 这就是市面上常见的“云”主机。 有的教材将第一类虚拟化技术称为裸金属架构, 将第二类虚拟化技术称为寄居架构。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

按发展历程又分为单道批处理系统、多道批处理系统(多道程序设计技术出现以后)。 1. 单道批处理系统 为实现对作业的连续处理, 需要先将一批作业以脱机方式输入磁带, 并在系统中配上监督程序(Monitor), 在其控制下, 使这批作业能一个接一个地连续处理。 虽然系统对作业的处理是成批进行的, 但内存中始终保持一道作业。 单道批处理系统的主要特征如下: 1) 自动性。在顺利的情况下, 磁带上的一批作业能自动地逐个运行, 而无须人工干预。 2) 顺序性。磁带上的各道作业顺序地进入内存, 先调入内存的作业先完成。 3) 单道性。内存中仅有一道程序运行, 即监督程序每次从磁带上只调入一道程序进入内存运行, 当该程序完成或发生异常情况时, 才换入其后继程序进入内存运行。 此时面临的问题是: 每次主机内存中仅存放一道作业, 每当它在运行期间(注意这里是“运行时”而不是“完成后”)发出输入/输出请求后, 高速的CPU便处于等待低速的I/O完成的状态。 为了进一步提高资源的利用率和系统的吞吐量, 引入了多道程序技术。 2. 多道批处理系统 用户所提交的作业都先存放在外存上并排成一个队列, 作业调度程序按一定的算法从后备队列中选择若干作业调入内存, 它们在管理程序的控制下相互穿插地运行, 共享系统中的各种硬/软件资源。 当某道程序因请求I/O 操作而暂停运行时, CPU便立即转去运行另一道程序, 这是通过中断机制实现的。 它让系统的各个组成部分都尽量的“忙”, 切换任务所花费的时间很少, 因而可实现系统各部件之间的并行工作, 使其在单位时间内的效率翻倍。 多道程序设计的特点是多道、宏观上并行、微观上串行。 1) 多道。计算机内存中同时存放多道相互独立的程序。 2) 宏观上并行。同时进入系统的多道程序都处于运行过程中, 但都未运行完毕。 3) 微观上串行。内存中的多道程序轮流占有CPU, 交替执行。 多道程序设计技术的实现需要解决下列问题: 1) 如何分配处理器。 2) 多道程序的内存分配问题。 3) I/O 设备如何分配。 4) 如何组织和存放大量的程序和数据, 以方便用户使用并保证其安全性与一致性。 在批处理系统中采用多道程序设计技术就形成了多道批处理操作系统。 该系统将用户提交的作业成批地送入计算机内存, 然后由作业调度程序自动地选择作业运行。 优点: 资源利用率高, 多道程序共享计算机资源, 从而使各种资源得到充分利用; 系统吞吐量大, CPU和其他资源保持“忙碌”状态。 缺点: 用户响应的时间较长; 不提供人机交互能力, 用户既不能了解自己的程序的运行情况, 又不能控制计算机。\n```",

按发展历程又分为单道批处理系统、多道批处理系统(多道程序设计技术出现以后)。 1. 单道批处理系统 为实现对作业的连续处理, 需要先将一批作业以脱机方式输入磁带, 并在系统中配上监督程序(Monitor), 在其控制下, 使这批作业能一个接一个地连续处理。 虽然系统对作业的处理是成批进行的, 但内存中始终保持一道作业。 单道批处理系统的主要特征如下: 1) 自动性。在顺利的情况下, 磁带上的一批作业能自动地逐个运行, 而无须人工干预。 2) 顺序性。磁带上的各道作业顺序地进入内存, 先调入内存的作业先完成。 3) 单道性。内存中仅有一道程序运行, 即监督程序每次从磁带上只调入一道程序进入内存运行, 当该程序完成或发生异常情况时, 才换入其后继程序进入内存运行。 此时面临的问题是: 每次主机内存中仅存放一道作业, 每当它在运行期间(注意这里是“运行时”而不是“完成后”)发出输入/输出请求后, 高速的CPU便处于等待低速的I/O完成的状态。 为了进一步提高资源的利用率和系统的吞吐量, 引入了多道程序技术。 2. 多道批处理系统 用户所提交的作业都先存放在外存上并排成一个队列, 作业调度程序按一定的算法从后备队列中选择若干作业调入内存, 它们在管理程序的控制下相互穿插地运行, 共享系统中的各种硬/软件资源。 当某道程序因请求I/O 操作而暂停运行时, CPU便立即转去运行另一道程序, 这是通过中断机制实现的。 它让系统的各个组成部分都尽量的“忙”, 切换任务所花费的时间很少, 因而可实现系统各部件之间的并行工作, 使其在单位时间内的效率翻倍。 多道程序设计的特点是多道、宏观上并行、微观上串行。 1) 多道。计算机内存中同时存放多道相互独立的程序。 2) 宏观上并行。同时进入系统的多道程序都处于运行过程中, 但都未运行完毕。 3) 微观上串行。内存中的多道程序轮流占有CPU, 交替执行。 多道程序设计技术的实现需要解决下列问题: 1) 如何分配处理器。 2) 多道程序的内存分配问题。 3) I/O 设备如何分配。 4) 如何组织和存放大量的程序和数据, 以方便用户使用并保证其安全性与一致性。 在批处理系统中采用多道程序设计技术就形成了多道批处理操作系统。 该系统将用户提交的作业成批地送入计算机内存, 然后由作业调度程序自动地选择作业运行。 优点: 资源利用率高, 多道程序共享计算机资源, 从而使各种资源得到充分利用; 系统吞吐量大, CPU和其他资源保持“忙碌”状态。 缺点: 用户响应的时间较长; 不提供人机交互能力, 用户既不能了解自己的程序的运行情况, 又不能控制计算机。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:**

②一些较基本的功能; ③客户和服务器之间的通信。 这些部分只是为构建通用操作系统提供一个重要基础, 这样就可以确保将内核做得很小。 操作系统中的绝大部分功能都放在微内核外的一组服务器(进程)中实现, 如用于提供对进程(线程)进行管理的进程(线程)服务器、提供虚拟存储器管理功能的虚拟存储器服务器等, 它们都是作为进程来实现的, 运行在用户态, 客户与服务器之间是借助微内核提供的消息传递机制来实现交互的。 在微内核结构中, 为了实现高可靠性, 只有微内核运行在内核态, 其余模块都运行在用户态, 一个模块中的错误只会使这个模块崩溃, 而不会使整个系统崩溃。 例如, 文件服务代码运行时出了问题, 宏内核因为文件服务是运行在内核态的, 系统直接就崩溃了。 而微内核的文件服务是运行在用户态的, 只要将文件服务功能强行停止, 然后重启, 就可以继续使用, 系统不会崩溃。 (2) 微内核的基本功能 微内核结构通常利用“机制与策略分离”的原理来构造OS结构, 将机制部分以及与硬件紧密相关的部分放入微内核。 微内核通常具有如下功能: ①进程(线程)管理。进程(线程)之间的通信功能是微内核OS最基本的功能, 此外还有进程的切换、进程的调度, 以及多处理机之间的同步等功能, 都应放入微内核。 举个例子, 为实现进程调度功能, 需要在进程管理中设置一个或多个进程优先级队列, 这部分属于调度功能的机制部分, 应将它放入微内核。 而对用户进程如何分类, 以及优先级的确认方式, 则属于策略问题, 可将它们放入微内核外的进程管理服务器中。 ②低级存储器管理。在微内核中, 只配置最基本的低级存储器管理机制, 如用于实现将逻辑地址变换为物理地址等的页表机制和地址变换机制, 这一部分是依赖于硬件的, 因此放入微内核。 而实现虚拟存储器管理的策略, 则包含应采取何种页面置换算法、采用何种内存分配与回收的策略, 应将这部分放在微内核外的存储器管理服务器中。 ③中断和陷入处理。微内核OS将与硬件紧密相关的一小部分放入微内核, 此时微内核的主要功能是捕获所发生的中断和陷入事件, 并进行中断响应处理, 在识别中断或陷入的事件后, 再发送给相关的服务器来处理, 所以中断和陷入处理也应放入微内核。 微内核操作系统将进程管理、存储器管理以及I/O管理这些功能一分为二, 属于机制的很小一部分放入微内核, 而绝大部分放入微内核外的各种服务器实现, 大多数服务器都要比微内核大。 因此, 在采用客户/服务器模式时, 能将微内核做得很小。 (3) 微内核的特点 微内核结构的主要优点如下所示。 ①扩展性和灵活性。许多功能从内核中分离出来, 当要修改某些功能或增加新功能时, 只需在相应的服务器中修改或新增功能, 或再增加一个专用的服务器, 而无须改动内核代码。 ②可靠性和安全性。前面已举例说明。 ③可移植性。与CPU和I/O硬件有关的代码均放在内核中, 而其他各种服务器均与硬件平台无关, 因而将操作系统移植到另一个平台上所需做的修改是比较小的。 ④分布式计算。客户和服务器之间、服务器和服务器之间的通信采用消息传递机制, 这就使得微内核系统能很好地支持分布式系统和网络系统。 微内核结构的主要问题是性能\n```",

②一些较基本的功能; ③客户和服务器之间的通信。 这些部分只是为构建通用操作系统提供一个重要基础, 这样就可以确保将内核做得很小。 操作系统中的绝大部分功能都放在微内核外的一组服务器(进程)中实现, 如用于提供对进程(线程)进行管理的进程(线程)服务器、提供虚拟存储器管理功能的虚拟存储器服务器等, 它们都是作为进程来实现的, 运行在用户态, 客户与服务器之间是借助微内核提供的消息传递机制来实现交互的。 在微内核结构中, 为了实现高可靠性, 只有微内核运行在内核态, 其余模块都运行在用户态, 一个模块中的错误只会使这个模块崩溃, 而不会使整个系统崩溃。 例如, 文件服务代码运行时出了问题, 宏内核因为文件服务是运行在内核态的, 系统直接就崩溃了。 而微内核的文件服务是运行在用户态的, 只要将文件服务功能强行停止, 然后重启, 就可以继续使用, 系统不会崩溃。 (2) 微内核的基本功能 微内核结构通常利用“机制与策略分离”的原理来构造OS结构, 将机制部分以及与硬件紧密相关的部分放入微内核。 微内核通常具有如下功能: ①进程(线程)管理。进程(线程)之间的通信功能是微内核OS最基本的功能, 此外还有进程的切换、进程的调度, 以及多处理机之间的同步等功能, 都应放入微内核。 举个例子, 为实现进程调度功能, 需要在进程管理中设置一个或多个进程优先级队列, 这部分属于调度功能的机制部分, 应将它放入微内核。 而对用户进程如何分类, 以及优先级的确认方式, 则属于策略问题, 可将它们放入微内核外的进程管理服务器中。 ②低级存储器管理。在微内核中, 只配置最基本的低级存储器管理机制, 如用于实现将逻辑地址变换为物理地址等的页表机制和地址变换机制, 这一部分是依赖于硬件的, 因此放入微内核。 而实现虚拟存储器管理的策略, 则包含应采取何种页面置换算法、采用何种内存分配与回收的策略, 应将这部分放在微内核外的存储器管理服务器中。 ③中断和陷入处理。微内核OS将与硬件紧密相关的一小部分放入微内核, 此时微内核的主要功能是捕获所发生的中断和陷入事件, 并进行中断响应处理, 在识别中断或陷入的事件后, 再发送给相关的服务器来处理, 所以中断和陷入处理也应放入微内核。 微内核操作系统将进程管理、存储器管理以及I/O管理这些功能一分为二, 属于机制的很小一部分放入微内核, 而绝大部分放入微内核外的各种服务器实现, 大多数服务器都要比微内核大。 因此, 在采用客户/服务器模式时, 能将微内核做得很小。 (3) 微内核的特点 微内核结构的主要优点如下所示。 ①扩展性和灵活性。许多功能从内核中分离出来, 当要修改某些功能或增加新功能时, 只需在相应的服务器中修改或新增功能, 或再增加一个专用的服务器, 而无须改动内核代码。 ②可靠性和安全性。前面已举例说明。 ③可移植性。与CPU和I/O硬件有关的代码均放在内核中, 而其他各种服务器均与硬件平台无关, 因而将操作系统移植到另一个平台上所需做的修改是比较小的。 ④分布式计算。客户和服务器之间、服务器和服务器之间的通信采用消息传递机制, 这就使得微内核系统能很好地支持分布式系统和网络系统。 微内核结构的主要问题是性能\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

则该作业暂时停止运行, 将处理器让给其他作业使用, 等待下一轮再继续运行。 计算机速度很快, 作业运行轮转得也很快, 因此给每个用户的感觉就像是自己独占一台计算机。 分时操作系统是指多个用户通过终端同时共享一台主机, 这些终端连接在主机上, 用户可以同时与主机进行交互操作而互不干扰。 因此, 实现分时系统的关键问题是如何使用户能与自己的作业进行交互, 即当用户在自己的终端上键入命令时, 系统应能及时接收并及时处理该命令, 再将结果返回用户。 分时系统也是支持多道程序设计的系统, 但它不同于多道批处理系统。 多道批处理是实现作业自动控制而无须人工干预的系统, 而分时系统是实现人机交互的系统, 这使得分时系统具有与批处理系统不同的特征。 分时系统的主要特征如下: 1) 同时性。同时性也称多路性, 指允许多个终端用户同时使用一台计算机。 2) 交互性。用户通过终端采用人机对话的方式直接控制程序运行, 与同程序进行交互。 3) 独立性。系统中多个用户可以彼此独立地进行操作, 互不干扰, 单个用户感觉不到别人也在使用这台计算机, 好像只有自己单独使用这台计算机一样。 4) 及时性。用户请求能在很短时间内获得响应。 虽然分时操作系统较好地解决了人机交互问题, 但在一些应用场合, 需要系统能对外部的信息在规定的时间(比时间片的时间还短)内做出处理(比如飞机订票系统或导弹制导系统), 因此, 实时操作系统应运而生。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be
