主存和I/O设备之间交换信息时，不通过CPU。但当I/O设备和CPU同时访问主存时，可能发生冲突，为了有效地使用主存，DMA与CPU通常采用以下3种方式使用主存。 (1)停止CPU访存。 当I/O设备有DMA请求时，由DMA接口向CPU发送一个停止信号，使CPU放弃总线控制权，停止访问主存，直到DMA传送一块数据结束。数据传送结束后，DMA 接口通知CPU可以使用主存，并把总线控制权交回给CPU。 优点：控制简单，适用于数据传输速率很高的I/O设备实现成组数据的传送。 缺点：DMA在访问主存时，CPU基本上处于不工作状态。 (2)周期挪用。 由于I/O访存的优先级高于CPU访存(I/O不立即访存就可能丢失数据),因此由I/O设备挪用一个存取周期，传送完一个数据字后立即释放总线。它是一种单字传送方式。当I/O设备有DMA 请求时，会遇到3种情况：①此时CPU不在访存，因此I/O 的访存请求与CPU未发生冲突；②CPU正在访存，此时必须待存取周期结束后，CPU再将总线占有权让出； ③I/O和CPU同时请求访存，出现访存冲突，此时CPU要暂时放弃总线占有权。 优点：既实现了I/O传送，又较好地发挥了主存与CPU的效率。 缺点：每挪用一个主存周期，DMA 接口都要申请、建立和归还总线控制权。 (3)DMA与CPU交替访存。 将CPU的工作周期分成两个时间片，一个给CPU访存，另一个给DMA访存，这样在每个CPU周期内，CPU和DMA就都可以轮流访存。这种方式适用于CPU 的工作周期比主存存取周期长的情况。例如，若CPU的工作周期是1.2μs, 主存的存取周期小于0.6μs，则可将一个CPU周期分为C₁和C₂两个周期，其中C₁专供DMA访存，C₂专供CPU访存。这种方式不需要申请、建立和归还总线使用权，总线使用权是通过C₁ 和 C₂ 分时控制的。 优点：不需要总线控制权的申请、建立和归还过程，具有很高的传送速率。 缺点：相应的硬件逻辑变得更复杂。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\":

（1）同步定时方式。 所谓同步定时方式，是指系统采用一个统一的时钟信号来协调发送和接收双方的传送定时关系。时钟产生相等的时间间隔，每个间隔构成一个总线周期。在一个总线周期中，发送方和接收方可以进行一次数据传送。因为采用统一的时钟，每个部件或设备发送或接收信息都在固定的总线传送周期中，一个总线的传送周期结束，下一个总线的传送周期开始。 优点：传送速度快，具有较高的传输速率；总线控制逻辑简单。 缺点：主从设备属于强制性同步；不能及时进行数据通信的有效性检验，可靠性较差。 同步通信适用于总线长度较短及总线所接部件的存取时间比较接近的系统。 同步串行通信方式是发送方时钟直接控制接收方时钟，使双方完全同步的一种逐位传输的通信方式。使用同步串行通信时，收发双方的时钟严格一致，因此仅在数据块的头尾处添加了开始和结束标记，传输效率较高，但实现的硬件设备也更复杂，所以较少采用。 （2）异步定时方式。 在异步定时方式中，没有统一的时钟，也没有固定的时间间隔，完全依靠传送双方相互制约的“握手”信号来实现定时控制。通常，主设备提出交换信息的“请求”信号，经接口传送到从设备；从设备接到主设备的请求后，通过接口向主设备发出“回答”信号。 优点：总线周期长度可变，能保证两个工作速度相差很大的部件或设备之间可靠地进行信息交换，自动适应时间的配合。 缺点：比同步控制方式稍复杂一些，速度比同步定时方式慢。 根据“请求”和“回答”信号的撤销是否互锁，异步定时方式又分为以下3种类型。 1)不互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，不必等到接到从设备的“回答”信号，而是经过一段时间便撤销“请求”信号。而从设备在接到“请求”信号后，发出“回答”信号， 并经过一段时间后自动撤销“回答”信号。双方不存在互锁关系。 2)半互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，必须在接到从设备的“回答”信号后，才撤销“请求”信号，有互锁的关系。而从设备在接到“请求”信号后，发出“回答”信号， 但不必等待获知主设备的“请求”信号已经撤销，而是隔一段时间后自动撤销“回答” 信号，不存在互锁关系。 3)全互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，必须在从设备“回答”后才撤销“请求”信号；从设备发出“回答”信号后，必须在获知主设备“请求”信号已撤销后，再撤销其 “回答”信号。双方存在互锁关系。 现在越来越多的总线采用异步串行通信方式，使用异步串行通信时，收发双方时钟不严格一致，因此每个字符都要用开始位和停止位作为字符开始和结束的标志，从而保证数据传输的准确性。异步串行通信的第一位是开始位，表示字符传送的开始。当通信线上没有数据传送时处于逻辑“1”状态，当发送方要发送一个字符时，首先发出一个逻辑“0”信号，即开始位。接收方检测到这个逻辑低电平后，就开始准备接收数据位。在字符传送过程中，数据位从最低位开始，一位一位地传输。当字符发送完后，就可以发送奇偶校验位(可选),以用于有限的差错检测。在奇偶位或数据位之后发送的是停止位，表示一个字符数据的结束。 （3）半同步定时方式。 半同步定时方式保留了同步定时的特点，如所有地址、命令、数据信号的发出时间都严格参照系统时钟的某个前沿开始，而接收方都采用系统时钟后沿时刻来进行判断识别；同时，又像异步定时那样，允许不同速度的设备和谐地工作。为此增设一条Wait 响应信号线。例如，某个半同步总线总是从某个时钟开始，在每个时钟到来时，采样Wait 信号，若无效，则说明数据未准备好， 下个时钟到来时，再采样Wait信号，直到检测到有效，再去数据线上取数据。半同步定时适用于系统工作速度不高，但又包含了由许多速度差异较大的各\n```",

设备(通过I/O接口)都挂在一组总线上，允许I/O设备之间、I/O设备与主存之间直接交换信息。CPU与主存、CPU与外设之间都可以通过总线直接进行信息交换，而无须经过中间设备的干预。需要注意的是，单总线并不是指只有一根信号线，系统总线按传送信息的不同可细分为地址总线、数据总线和控制总线。 优点：结构简单，成本低，易于接入新的设备 。 缺点：带宽低、负载重，多个部件只能争用唯一的总线，且不支持并发传送操作。 （2）双总线结构。 双总线结构有两条总线：一条是主存总线，用于在CPU 、主存和通道之间传送数据；另一条是I/O 总线，用于在多个外部设备与通道之间传送数据，如图6.2所示。 优点：将低速I/O 设备从原单总线上分离出来，实现了存储器总线和 I/O总线分离。 缺点：需要增加通道等硬件设备 。 （3）三总线结构。 三总线结构是在计算机系统各部件之间采用3条各自独立的总线来构成信息通路，这三条总线分别为主存总线、I/O总线和直接内存访问(DMA)总线。 主存总线用于在CPU和内存之间传送地址、数据和控制信息。I/O总线用于在CPU和各类外设之间通信。DMA总线用于在内存和高速外设之间直接传送数据。 优点：提高了I/O设备的性能，使其更快地响应命令，提高系统吞吐量。 缺点：任意时刻只能使用一种总线，系统工作效率较低。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict

以上三种定时方式都从主设备发出地址和读/写命令开始，直到数据传输结束，在整个传输周期中，总线的使用权完全由主设备及由其选中的从设备占据。其实，从设备在准备数据的阶段， 总线纯属空闲等待，为进一步挖掘总线的潜力，又提出了分离式定时方式。 （4）分离式定时方式。 分离式定时方式将总线事务分解为请求和应答两个子过程。在第一个子过程中，主设备A获得总线使用权后，将命令、地址等信息发到总线上，经总线传输后由从设备B接收。此过程占用总线的时间很短，主设备一旦发送完，立即释放总线，以便其他设备使用。在第二个子过程中，设备B收到设备A发来的有关命令后，将设备A所需的数据准备好后，便由设备B 申请总线使用权，一旦获准，设备B便将相应的数据送到总线上，由设备A 接收。上述两个子过程都只有单方向的信息流，每个设备都变为主设备。 优点：在不传送数据时释放总线，使总线可接受其他设备的请求，不存在空闲等待时间。 缺点：控制复杂，开销也大。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to

（1）同步定时方式。 所谓同步定时方式，是指系统采用一个统一的时钟信号来协调发送和接收双方的传送定时关系。时钟产生相等的时间间隔，每个间隔构成一个总线周期。在一个总线周期中，发送方和接收方可以进行一次数据传送。因为采用统一的时钟，每个部件或设备发送或接收信息都在固定的总线传送周期中，一个总线的传送周期结束，下一个总线的传送周期开始。 优点：传送速度快，具有较高的传输速率；总线控制逻辑简单。 缺点：主从设备属于强制性同步；不能及时进行数据通信的有效性检验，可靠性较差。 同步通信适用于总线长度较短及总线所接部件的存取时间比较接近的系统。 同步串行通信方式是发送方时钟直接控制接收方时钟，使双方完全同步的一种逐位传输的通信方式。使用同步串行通信时，收发双方的时钟严格一致，因此仅在数据块的头尾处添加了开始和结束标记，传输效率较高，但实现的硬件设备也更复杂，所以较少采用。 （2）异步定时方式。 在异步定时方式中，没有统一的时钟，也没有固定的时间间隔，完全依靠传送双方相互制约的“握手”信号来实现定时控制。通常，主设备提出交换信息的“请求”信号，经接口传送到从设备；从设备接到主设备的请求后，通过接口向主设备发出“回答”信号。 优点：总线周期长度可变，能保证两个工作速度相差很大的部件或设备之间可靠地进行信息交换，自动适应时间的配合。 缺点：比同步控制方式稍复杂一些，速度比同步定时方式慢。 根据“请求”和“回答”信号的撤销是否互锁，异步定时方式又分为以下3种类型。 1)不互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，不必等到接到从设备的“回答”信号，而是经过一段时间便撤销“请求”信号。而从设备在接到“请求”信号后，发出“回答”信号， 并经过一段时间后自动撤销“回答”信号。双方不存在互锁关系。 2)半互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，必须在接到从设备的“回答”信号后，才撤销“请求”信号，有互锁的关系。而从设备在接到“请求”信号后，发出“回答”信号， 但不必等待获知主设备的“请求”信号已经撤销，而是隔一段时间后自动撤销“回答” 信号，不存在互锁关系。 3)全互锁方式。主设备发出“请求”信号后，必须在从设备“回答”后才撤销“请求”信号；从设备发出“回答”信号后，必须在获知主设备“请求”信号已撤销后，再撤销其 “回答”信号。双方存在互锁关系。 现在越来越多的总线采用异步串行通信方式，使用异步串行通信时，收发双方时钟不严格一致，因此每个字符都要用开始位和停止位作为字符开始和结束的标志，从而保证数据传输的准确性。异步串行通信的第一位是开始位，表示字符传送的开始。当通信线上没有数据传送时处于逻辑“1”状态，当发送方要发送一个字符时，首先发出一个逻辑“0”信号，即开始位。接收方检测到这个逻辑低电平后，就开始准备接收数据位。在字符传送过程中，数据位从最低位开始，一位一位地传输。当字符发送完后，就可以发送奇偶校验位(可选),以用于有限的差错检测。在奇偶位或数据位之后发送的是停止位，表示一个字符数据的结束。 （3）半同步定时方式。 半同步定时方式保留了同步定时的特点，如所有地址、命令、数据信号的发出时间都严格参照系统时钟的某个前沿开始，而接收方都采用系统时钟后沿时刻来进行判断识别；同时，又像异步定时那样，允许不同速度的设备和谐地工作。为此增设一条Wait 响应信号线。例如，某个半同步总线总是从某个时钟开始，在每个时钟到来时，采样Wait 信号，若无效，则说明数据未准备好， 下个时钟到来时，再采样Wait信号，直到检测到有效，再去数据线上取数据。半同步定时适用于系统工作速度不高，但又包含了由许多速度差异较大的各\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be

2)系统总线。计算机系统内各功能部件(CPU、 主存、I/O 接口)之间相互连接的总线。 按系统总线传输信息内容的不同，又可分为3类：数据总线、地址总线和控制总线。 ①数据总线用来在各部件之间传输数据、指令和中断类型号等，它是双向传输总线，数据总线的位数反映一次能传送的数据的位数。 ②地址总线用来指出数据总线上源数据或目的数据所在的主存单元或I/O 端口的地址，它是单向传输总线，地址总线的位数反映最大的寻址空间。 ③控制总线用来传输各种命令、反馈和定时信号，典型的控制信号包括时钟、复位、总线请求/允许、中断请求/回答、存储器读/写、I/O读、I/O写、传输确认等。 注意区分数据通路和数据总线：各个功能部件通过数据总线连接形成的数据传输路径称为数据通路。数据通路表示的是数据流经的路径，而数据总线是数据传输的媒介。 3)I/O总线。主要用于连接中低速的I/O 设备，通过 I/O 接口与系统总线相连接，目的是将低速设备与高速总线分离，以提升总线的系统性能，常见的有USB 、PCI 总线。 4)通信总线。计算机系统之间或计算机系统与其他系统(如远程通信设备、测试设备)之间传送信息的总线，通信总线也称外部总线。 （2）按时序控制方式分类。 1)同步总线。总线上连接的部件或设备通过统一的时钟进行同步，在规定的时钟节拍内进行规定的总线操作，来完成部件或设备之间的信息传输。 2)异步总线。总线上连接的部件或设备没有统一的时钟，而以信号握手的方式来协调各部件或设备之间的信息传输，总线操作时序不是固定的。 （3）按数据传输方式分类。 1)串行总线。只有一条双向传输或两条单向传输的数据线，数据按比特位串行顺序传输， 其效率低于并行总线。串行传输对数据线的要求不太高，因此适合长距离通信。 2)并行总线。有多条双向传输的数据线，可以实现多比特位的同时传输，其效率比串行总线更高。缺点是各条数据线的传输特点可能存在一些差异，比如有的信息位可能延迟， 并且数据线之间相互干扰还会造成传输错误，因此并行总线适合近距离通信。 注意并行总线并不一定总比串行总线快，它们适合不同的场景。并行总线由于是多个数据位同时传输，需要考虑数据的协同性，以及线路之间的相互干扰，导致工作频率无法持续提高。而串行总线可通过不断提高工作频率来提高传输速度，使其速度最终超越并行总线的速度。\n```",

I/O 控制方式 在输入/输出系统中，经常需要进行大量的数据传输，而传输过程中有各种不同的I/O控制方式，基本的控制方式主要有以下四种： 1)程序查询方式。由CPU通过程序不断查询I/O 设备是否已做好准备，从而控制I/O 设备与主机交换信息。 2)程序中断方式。只在I/O设备准备就绪并向 CPU 发出中断请求时才予以响应。 3)DMA方式。主存和I/O设备之间有一条直接数据通路，当主存和 I/O设备交换信息时，无须调用中断服务程序。 4)通道方式。在系统中设有通道控制部件，每个通道都挂接若干外设，主机在执行I/O 命令时，只需启动有关通道，通道将执行通道程序，从而完成I/O 操作。 其中，方式1和方式2主要用于数据传输速率较低的外部设备，方式3和方式4主要用于数据传输速率较高的设备。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

2)系统总线。计算机系统内各功能部件(CPU、 主存、I/O 接口)之间相互连接的总线。 按系统总线传输信息内容的不同，又可分为3类：数据总线、地址总线和控制总线。 ①数据总线用来在各部件之间传输数据、指令和中断类型号等，它是双向传输总线，数据总线的位数反映一次能传送的数据的位数。 ②地址总线用来指出数据总线上源数据或目的数据所在的主存单元或I/O 端口的地址，它是单向传输总线，地址总线的位数反映最大的寻址空间。 ③控制总线用来传输各种命令、反馈和定时信号，典型的控制信号包括时钟、复位、总线请求/允许、中断请求/回答、存储器读/写、I/O读、I/O写、传输确认等。 注意区分数据通路和数据总线：各个功能部件通过数据总线连接形成的数据传输路径称为数据通路。数据通路表示的是数据流经的路径，而数据总线是数据传输的媒介。 3)I/O总线。主要用于连接中低速的I/O 设备，通过 I/O 接口与系统总线相连接，目的是将低速设备与高速总线分离，以提升总线的系统性能，常见的有USB 、PCI 总线。 4)通信总线。计算机系统之间或计算机系统与其他系统(如远程通信设备、测试设备)之间传送信息的总线，通信总线也称外部总线。 （2）按时序控制方式分类。 1)同步总线。总线上连接的部件或设备通过统一的时钟进行同步，在规定的时钟节拍内进行规定的总线操作，来完成部件或设备之间的信息传输。 2)异步总线。总线上连接的部件或设备没有统一的时钟，而以信号握手的方式来协调各部件或设备之间的信息传输，总线操作时序不是固定的。 （3）按数据传输方式分类。 1)串行总线。只有一条双向传输或两条单向传输的数据线，数据按比特位串行顺序传输， 其效率低于并行总线。串行传输对数据线的要求不太高，因此适合长距离通信。 2)并行总线。有多条双向传输的数据线，可以实现多比特位的同时传输，其效率比串行总线更高。缺点是各条数据线的传输特点可能存在一些差异，比如有的信息位可能延迟， 并且数据线之间相互干扰还会造成传输错误，因此并行总线适合近距离通信。 注意并行总线并不一定总比串行总线快，它们适合不同的场景。并行总线由于是多个数据位同时传输，需要考虑数据的协同性，以及线路之间的相互干扰，导致工作频率无法持续提高。而串行总线可通过不断提高工作频率来提高传输速度，使其速度最终超越并行总线的速度。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and

As the core component of a computer's architecture, the CPU oversees the processing of data and orchestrates the coordination of all system operations. It is tasked with performing arithmetic, logic, and control functions required to run software applications and manage hardware interactions. The CPU executes instructions fetched from memory, processes them through its arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and directs data movement between components. It also manages interrupt responses by detecting and processing signals from peripheral devices and system events, ensuring timely and efficient handling of external inputs. This includes managing interrupt requests and responses, which allow the system to pause current tasks and address urgent operations, such as hardware signals or time-critical events. Furthermore, the CPU plays a key role in controlling input/output (I/O) processes, coordinating data transfers between the system and external devices. All descriptions consistently emphasize the CPU’s fundamental role in instruction execution, data flow management, system control, and interrupt handling, underscoring its position as the central component driving the functionality of a computing system.",

DMA控制器的组成 在DMA方式中，对数据传送过程进行控制的硬件称为DMA控制器 (DMA接口)。当 I/O设备需要进行数据传送时，通过DMA控制器向CPU提出DMA传送请求，CPU 响应之后将让出系统总线，由DMA控制器接管总线进行数据传送。其主要功能如下： 1)接受外设发出的DMA 请求，并向CPU 发出总线请求。 2)CPU响应并发出总线响应信号，DMA 接管总线控制权，进入DMA 操作周期。 3)确定传送数据的主存起始地址及长度，并自动修改主存地址计数和传送长度计数。 4)规定数据在主存和外设间的传送方向，发出读/写等控制信号，执行数据传送操作。 5 ) 向CPU 报告DMA 操作结束。 一个简单的DMA 控制器包含以下部件： 1)主存地址计数器：存放要交换数据的主存地址。在传送前，其保存的是传送数据的主存起始地址；每传送一个字，地址寄存器的内容就加1,直至该批数据传送完毕。 2)传送长度计数器：记录传送数据的总长度。在传送前，其记录的是该批数据的总字数；每传送一个字，计数器就减1,直至计数器为0,表示该批数据传送完毕。 3)数据缓冲寄存器：暂存每次传送的数据。通常，DMA接口与主存之间的传送单位为字， 而DMA与设备之间的传送单位可能为字节或位。 ·DMA请求触发器：每当I/O设备准备好数据后，发出一个控制信号，使DMA 请求触发器置位 。 4)“控制/状态”逻辑：用于指定传送方向，修改传送参数，并对DMA请求信号、CPU 响应信号进行协调和同步。 5)中断机构：当一批数据传送完毕后触发中断机构，向CPU 提出中断请求。 在 DMA 传送过程中，DMA 控制器接管系统总线。而当DMA 传送结束后，将恢复CPU 的一切权利并开始执行其操作。由此可见，DMA 控制器必须具有控制系统总线的能力。\n```",

DMA控制器的组成 在DMA方式中，对数据传送过程进行控制的硬件称为DMA控制器 (DMA接口)。当 I/O设备需要进行数据传送时，通过DMA控制器向CPU提出DMA传送请求，CPU 响应之后将让出系统总线，由DMA控制器接管总线进行数据传送。其主要功能如下： 1)接受外设发出的DMA 请求，并向CPU 发出总线请求。 2)CPU响应并发出总线响应信号，DMA 接管总线控制权，进入DMA 操作周期。 3)确定传送数据的主存起始地址及长度，并自动修改主存地址计数和传送长度计数。 4)规定数据在主存和外设间的传送方向，发出读/写等控制信号，执行数据传送操作。 5 ) 向CPU 报告DMA 操作结束。 一个简单的DMA 控制器包含以下部件： 1)主存地址计数器：存放要交换数据的主存地址。在传送前，其保存的是传送数据的主存起始地址；每传送一个字，地址寄存器的内容就加1,直至该批数据传送完毕。 2)传送长度计数器：记录传送数据的总长度。在传送前，其记录的是该批数据的总字数；每传送一个字，计数器就减1,直至计数器为0,表示该批数据传送完毕。 3)数据缓冲寄存器：暂存每次传送的数据。通常，DMA接口与主存之间的传送单位为字， 而DMA与设备之间的传送单位可能为字节或位。 ·DMA请求触发器：每当I/O设备准备好数据后，发出一个控制信号，使DMA 请求触发器置位 。 4)“控制/状态”逻辑：用于指定传送方向，修改传送参数，并对DMA请求信号、CPU 响应信号进行协调和同步。 5)中断机构：当一批数据传送完毕后触发中断机构，向CPU 提出中断请求。 在 DMA 传送过程中，DMA 控制器接管系统总线。而当DMA 传送结束后，将恢复CPU 的一切权利并开始执行其操作。由此可见，DMA 控制器必须具有控制系统总线的能力。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

I/O 接口 I/O接口(也称I/O控制器)是主机和外设之间的交接界面，通过接口可以实现主机和外设之间的信息交换。外设种类繁多，且具有不同的工作特性，它们在工作方式、数据格式和工作速度等方面有着很大的差异，接口正是为了解决这些差异而设置的。 I/O接口的主要功能如下： 1)进行地址译码和设备选择。CPU送来选择外设的地址码后，接口必须对地址进行译码以产生设备选择信息，使主机能和指定外设交换信息。 2)实现主机和外设的通信联络控制。解决主机与外设时序配合问题，协调不同工作速度的外设和主机之间交换信息，以保证整个计算机系统能统一、协调地工作。 3)实现数据缓冲。CPU与外设之间的速度往往不匹配，为消除速度差异，接口必须设置数据缓冲寄存器，用于数据的暂存，以避免因速度不一致而丢失数据。 4)信号格式的转换。外设与主机两者的电平、数据格式都可能存在差异，接口应提供主机与外设的信号格式的转换功能，如电平转换、并/串或串/并转换、模/数或数/模转换等。 5)传送控制命令和状态信息。CPU要启动某外设时，通过接口中的命令寄存器向外设发出启动命令；外设准备就绪时，则将“准备好”状态信息送回接口中的状态寄存器，并反馈给CPU。外设向CPU提出中断请求时，CPU也应有相应的响应信号反馈给外设。\n```",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

I/O 接口 I/O接口(也称I/O控制器)是主机和外设之间的交接界面，通过接口可以实现主机和外设之间的信息交换。外设种类繁多，且具有不同的工作特性，它们在工作方式、数据格式和工作速度等方面有着很大的差异，接口正是为了解决这些差异而设置的。 I/O接口的主要功能如下： 1)进行地址译码和设备选择。CPU送来选择外设的地址码后，接口必须对地址进行译码以产生设备选择信息，使主机能和指定外设交换信息。 2)实现主机和外设的通信联络控制。解决主机与外设时序配合问题，协调不同工作速度的外设和主机之间交换信息，以保证整个计算机系统能统一、协调地工作。 3)实现数据缓冲。CPU与外设之间的速度往往不匹配，为消除速度差异，接口必须设置数据缓冲寄存器，用于数据的暂存，以避免因速度不一致而丢失数据。 4)信号格式的转换。外设与主机两者的电平、数据格式都可能存在差异，接口应提供主机与外设的信号格式的转换功能，如电平转换、并/串或串/并转换、模/数或数/模转换等。 5)传送控制命令和状态信息。CPU要启动某外设时，通过接口中的命令寄存器向外设发出启动命令；外设准备就绪时，则将“准备好”状态信息送回接口中的状态寄存器，并反馈给CPU。外设向CPU提出中断请求时，CPU也应有相应的响应信号反馈给外设。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

对新的中断请求不予响应，则称这种中断为单重中断，如图7.5(a)所示。若CPU 暂停现行的中断服务程序， 转去处理新的中断请求，则称这种中断为多重中断，也称中断嵌套。 中断处理优先级是指多重中断的实际优先级处理次序，可以利用中断屏蔽技术动态调整，从而可以灵活地调整中断服务程序的优先级，使中断处理更加灵活。若不使用中断屏蔽技术，则处理优先级和响应优先级相同。现代计算机一般使用中断屏蔽技术，它通过在中断系统中设置中断屏蔽字寄存器来实现。每个中断源对应中断屏蔽字寄存器中的某一位，1表示屏蔽该中断源的请求，0表示可以正常请求。中断屏蔽字寄存器的内容称为中断屏蔽字。 来自设备i的中断请求信号(IRi) 记录在中断请求寄存器中的对应位，每个中断源都有对应的中断屏蔽字。CPU在执行某个中断服务程序时，会将该中断源的中断屏蔽字送入中断屏蔽字寄存器，所有中断请求信号都会与中断屏蔽字寄存器中对应位的非值进行逻辑“与”,然后被送入中断判优电路按固定的响应优先级进行仲裁。通过配置中断屏蔽字，可以动态改变中断处理优先级。但是，因为中断屏蔽字寄存器的内容只有在执行中断服务程序时才会被更新，所以中断屏蔽只在CPU 运行中断服务程序时才有用，其并不能改变CPU 运行主程序时的中断响应优先级。即使在CPU 运行中断服务程序时，同时到达的多个未屏蔽中断请求的处理也只能按中断判优电路的响应优先级进行处理。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input

DMA的数据传送流程 DMA的数据传送流程分为预处理、数据传送和后处理3个阶段。 (1)预处理。 由CPU完成一些必要的准备工作。首先，初始化DMA控制器中的有关寄存器、设置传送方向、测试并启动设备等。然后，CPU继续执行原程序，直到I/O设备准备好发送的数据(输入情况)或接收的数据(输出情况)时，I/O设备向DMA控制器发送DMA请求，再由DMA控制器向CPU发出总线请求(这两个过程也可统称DMA请求),用以传输数据。 (2)数据传送。 DMA以数据块为基本传送单位。DMA占用总线后的数据输入/输出操作都是通过循环来实现的，这一循环也是由DMA控制器实现的，即数据传送阶段完全由DMA (硬件)控制。 (3)后处理。 DMA控制器向CPU发送中断请求，CPU执行中断服务程序做 DMA 结束处理，包括校验数据(出错则转诊断程序)等后处理工作。 在DMA方式下，整个数据块的传送过程都不需要CPU参与 ，CPU只在最初的DMA 控制器初始化和最后的DMA结束处理时才介入，因此CPU 用于I/O 的开销非常小。\n```",

DMA的数据传送流程 DMA的数据传送流程分为预处理、数据传送和后处理3个阶段。 (1)预处理。 由CPU完成一些必要的准备工作。首先，初始化DMA控制器中的有关寄存器、设置传送方向、测试并启动设备等。然后，CPU继续执行原程序，直到I/O设备准备好发送的数据(输入情况)或接收的数据(输出情况)时，I/O设备向DMA控制器发送DMA请求，再由DMA控制器向CPU发出总线请求(这两个过程也可统称DMA请求),用以传输数据。 (2)数据传送。 DMA以数据块为基本传送单位。DMA占用总线后的数据输入/输出操作都是通过循环来实现的，这一循环也是由DMA控制器实现的，即数据传送阶段完全由DMA (硬件)控制。 (3)后处理。 DMA控制器向CPU发送中断请求，CPU执行中断服务程序做 DMA 结束处理，包括校验数据(出错则转诊断程序)等后处理工作。 在DMA方式下，整个数据块的传送过程都不需要CPU参与 ，CPU只在最初的DMA 控制器初始化和最后的DMA结束处理时才介入，因此CPU 用于I/O 的开销非常小。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

I/O 端口及其编址 I/O端口是指I/O接口电路中可被CPU直接访问的寄存器，主要有数据端口、状态端口和控制端口。通常，CPU能够对数据端口中的数据进行读/写操作；但对状态端口中的外设状态只能进行读操作，对控制端口中的各种控制命令只能进行写操作。 注意端口和接口是两个不同的概念，端口是指接口电路中可以进行读/写的寄存器。 I/O 端口要想能够被CPU访问，就必须要对各个端口进行编址，每个端口对应一个端口地址。 而对I/O 端口的编址方式有与存储器独立编址和统一编址两种。 (1 )独立编址。 独立编址也称I/O 映射方式，是指对所有的I/O 端口单独进行编址。I/O端口的地址空间与主存地址空间是两个独立的地址空间，它们的范围可以重叠，相同地址可能属于不同的地址空间。因此需设置专门的I/O指令来表明访问的是I/O地址空间，I/O指令的地址码给出 I/O端口号。 优点：I/O端口数比主存单元数少得多，只需少量地址线，使得I/O 端口译码简单，寻址速度更快。使用专用I/O 指令，可使得程序更加清晰，便于理解和检查。 缺点：I/O指令少，只提供简单的传输操作，所以程序设计的灵活性较差。此外，CPU 需要提供存储器读/写、I/O 设备读/写两组控制信号，增大了控制的复杂性。 (2)统一编址。 统一编址也称存储器映射方式，是指把主存地址空间分出一部分给 I/O 端口进行编址，I/O 端口和主存单元在同一地址空间的不同分段中，根据地址范围就能区分访问的是I/O 端口还是主存单元，因此无须设置专门的I/O 指令，用统一的访存指令就可访问I/O 端口。 优点：不需要专门的I/O 指令，使得CPU 访问I/O 的操作更加灵活和方便，还使端口有较大的编址空间。I/O 访问的保护机制可由虚拟存储管理系统来实现，无须专门设置。 缺点：端口地址占用了部分主存地址空间，使主存可用容量变小。此外，由于在识别I/O 端口时全部地址线都需要参加译码，使得译码电路变得更复杂，降低了译码速度。\n```",

I/O 端口及其编址 I/O端口是指I/O接口电路中可被CPU直接访问的寄存器，主要有数据端口、状态端口和控制端口。通常，CPU能够对数据端口中的数据进行读/写操作；但对状态端口中的外设状态只能进行读操作，对控制端口中的各种控制命令只能进行写操作。 注意端口和接口是两个不同的概念，端口是指接口电路中可以进行读/写的寄存器。 I/O 端口要想能够被CPU访问，就必须要对各个端口进行编址，每个端口对应一个端口地址。 而对I/O 端口的编址方式有与存储器独立编址和统一编址两种。 (1 )独立编址。 独立编址也称I/O 映射方式，是指对所有的I/O 端口单独进行编址。I/O端口的地址空间与主存地址空间是两个独立的地址空间，它们的范围可以重叠，相同地址可能属于不同的地址空间。因此需设置专门的I/O指令来表明访问的是I/O地址空间，I/O指令的地址码给出 I/O端口号。 优点：I/O端口数比主存单元数少得多，只需少量地址线，使得I/O 端口译码简单，寻址速度更快。使用专用I/O 指令，可使得程序更加清晰，便于理解和检查。 缺点：I/O指令少，只提供简单的传输操作，所以程序设计的灵活性较差。此外，CPU 需要提供存储器读/写、I/O 设备读/写两组控制信号，增大了控制的复杂性。 (2)统一编址。 统一编址也称存储器映射方式，是指把主存地址空间分出一部分给 I/O 端口进行编址，I/O 端口和主存单元在同一地址空间的不同分段中，根据地址范围就能区分访问的是I/O 端口还是主存单元，因此无须设置专门的I/O 指令，用统一的访存指令就可访问I/O 端口。 优点：不需要专门的I/O 指令，使得CPU 访问I/O 的操作更加灵活和方便，还使端口有较大的编址空间。I/O 访问的保护机制可由虚拟存储管理系统来实现，无须专门设置。 缺点：端口地址占用了部分主存地址空间，使主存可用容量变小。此外，由于在识别I/O 端口时全部地址线都需要参加译码，使得译码电路变得更复杂，降低了译码速度。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

(2)鼠标。 鼠标是常用的定位输入设备，它把用户的操作与计算机屏幕上的位置信息相联系。 （2）输出设备 (1)显示器。 按所用的显示器件分类，有阴极射线管 (CRT)显示器、液晶显示器 (LCD) 、 发光二极管 (LED)显示器等。显示器属于用点阵方式运行的设备，有以下主要参数。 1)屏幕大小：以对角线长度表示，单位为英寸，常用的有12～32英寸等。 2)分辨率：能表示的像素个数，屏幕上的每个光点就是一个像素，以宽和高的像素数的乘积表示，如800×600、1024×768和1280×1024等。 3)灰度级：指黑白显示器中所显示的像素点的亮暗差别，在彩色显示器中则表现为颜色的不同，灰度级越多，图像层次越清楚、逼真，典型的有8位(256级)、16位等。 4)刷新：光点只能保持极短的时间便会消失，为此必须在光点消失之前再重新扫描显示一遍，这个过程称为刷新。 5)刷新频率：指单位时间内扫描整个屏幕内容的次数。按照人的视觉生理，刷新频率大于 30Hz 时才不会感到闪烁，通常显示器的刷新频率为60～120Hz。 6)显示存储器 (VR AM): 也称刷新存储器，为了不断提高刷新图像的信号，必须把一帧图像信息存储在刷新存储器中。其存储容量由图像分辨率和灰度级决定，分辨率越高，灰度级越多，刷新存储器容量越大。 VRAM容量=分辨率×灰度级位数 VRAM带宽=分辨率×灰度级位数×帧频 (2)打印机。 用于将计算机的处理结果打印在相关介质上。按工作方式，打印机可分为点阵打印机、针式打印机、喷墨式打印机、激光打印机等。 1)针式打印机。针式打印机擅长“多层复写打印”,实现各种票据或蜡纸等的打印。其工作原理简单，造价低廉，耗材(色带)便宜，但打印分辨率和打印速度不够高。 2)喷墨式打印机。彩色喷墨打印机基于三基色原理，即分别喷射三种颜色的墨滴，按一定的比例混合出所要求的颜色。喷墨式打印机可实现高质量彩色打印。 3)激光打印机。计算机输出的二进制信息，经过调制后转换为激光束，在感光鼓上形成潜像，再经过显影、转印和定影，在纸上得到所需的字符或图像。激光打印机打印质量高、 速度快、处理能力强，它是将激光技术和电子显像技术相结合的产物。 （3）外部存储器(辅存) (1)磁表面存储器。 所谓“磁表面存储”,是指把某些磁性材料薄薄地涂在金属铝或塑料表面上作为载磁体来存储信息。磁盘存储器、磁带存储器和磁鼓存储器均属于磁表面存储器。 (2)固态硬盘(SSD)。 微小型高档笔记本电脑采用高性能 Flash 存储器作为硬盘来记录数据，这种“硬盘”称为固态硬盘 (S SD )。固态硬盘除需要Flash 存储器外，还需要其他硬件和软件的支持。 (3)光盘存储器。 光盘存储器是利用光学原理读/写信息的存储装置，它采用聚焦激光束对盘式介质以非接触方式记录信息。完整的光盘存储系统由光盘片、光盘驱动器、光盘控制器等组成。\n```",

(2)鼠标。 鼠标是常用的定位输入设备，它把用户的操作与计算机屏幕上的位置信息相联系。 （2）输出设备 (1)显示器。 按所用的显示器件分类，有阴极射线管 (CRT)显示器、液晶显示器 (LCD) 、 发光二极管 (LED)显示器等。显示器属于用点阵方式运行的设备，有以下主要参数。 1)屏幕大小：以对角线长度表示，单位为英寸，常用的有12～32英寸等。 2)分辨率：能表示的像素个数，屏幕上的每个光点就是一个像素，以宽和高的像素数的乘积表示，如800×600、1024×768和1280×1024等。 3)灰度级：指黑白显示器中所显示的像素点的亮暗差别，在彩色显示器中则表现为颜色的不同，灰度级越多，图像层次越清楚、逼真，典型的有8位(256级)、16位等。 4)刷新：光点只能保持极短的时间便会消失，为此必须在光点消失之前再重新扫描显示一遍，这个过程称为刷新。 5)刷新频率：指单位时间内扫描整个屏幕内容的次数。按照人的视觉生理，刷新频率大于 30Hz 时才不会感到闪烁，通常显示器的刷新频率为60～120Hz。 6)显示存储器 (VR AM): 也称刷新存储器，为了不断提高刷新图像的信号，必须把一帧图像信息存储在刷新存储器中。其存储容量由图像分辨率和灰度级决定，分辨率越高，灰度级越多，刷新存储器容量越大。 VRAM容量=分辨率×灰度级位数 VRAM带宽=分辨率×灰度级位数×帧频 (2)打印机。 用于将计算机的处理结果打印在相关介质上。按工作方式，打印机可分为点阵打印机、针式打印机、喷墨式打印机、激光打印机等。 1)针式打印机。针式打印机擅长“多层复写打印”,实现各种票据或蜡纸等的打印。其工作原理简单，造价低廉，耗材(色带)便宜，但打印分辨率和打印速度不够高。 2)喷墨式打印机。彩色喷墨打印机基于三基色原理，即分别喷射三种颜色的墨滴，按一定的比例混合出所要求的颜色。喷墨式打印机可实现高质量彩色打印。 3)激光打印机。计算机输出的二进制信息，经过调制后转换为激光束，在感光鼓上形成潜像，再经过显影、转印和定影，在纸上得到所需的字符或图像。激光打印机打印质量高、 速度快、处理能力强，它是将激光技术和电子显像技术相结合的产物。 （3）外部存储器(辅存) (1)磁表面存储器。 所谓“磁表面存储”,是指把某些磁性材料薄薄地涂在金属铝或塑料表面上作为载磁体来存储信息。磁盘存储器、磁带存储器和磁鼓存储器均属于磁表面存储器。 (2)固态硬盘(SSD)。 微小型高档笔记本电脑采用高性能 Flash 存储器作为硬盘来记录数据，这种“硬盘”称为固态硬盘 (S SD )。固态硬盘除需要Flash 存储器外，还需要其他硬件和软件的支持。 (3)光盘存储器。 光盘存储器是利用光学原理读/写信息的存储装置，它采用聚焦激光束对盘式介质以非接触方式记录信息。完整的光盘存储系统由光盘片、光盘驱动器、光盘控制器等组成。\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Alex<|#|>person<|#|>Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>Taylor<|#|>person<|#|>Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.\nentity<|#|>Jordan<|#|>person<|#|>Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.\nentity<|#|>Cruz<|#|>person<|#|>Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>The Device<|#|>equiment<|#|>The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Taylor<|#|>power dynamics, observation<|#|>Alex observes Taylor's authoritarian behavior and notes changes in Taylor's attitude toward the device.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Jordan<|#|>shared goals, rebellion<|#|>Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz's vision.)\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>Jordan<|#|>conflict resolution, mutual respect<|#|>Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce.\nrelation<|#|>Jordan<|#|>Cruz<|#|>ideological conflict, rebellion<|#|>Jordan's commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz's vision of control and order.\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>The Device<|#|>reverence, technological significance<|#|>Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nStock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.
